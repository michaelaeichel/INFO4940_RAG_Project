Generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems

Abstract
We consider the polynomial representation of Double Affine Hecke Algebras (DAHAs) and construct its submodules as ideals of functions vanishing on the special collections of affine planes.
This generalizes certain results of Kasatani in types An, (Cn∨,Cn).
We obtain commutative algebras of difference operators given by the action of invariant combinations of Cherednik-Dunkl operators in the corresponding quotient modules of the polynomial representation.
This gives known and new generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems.
Thus in the cases of DAHAs of types An and (Cn∨,Cn) we derive Chalykh-Sergeev-Veselov operators and a generalization of the Koornwinder operator respectively, together with complete sets of quantum integrals in the explicit form.

Introduction
The main goal of this paper is to obtain commutative algebras of difference operators containing generalizations of Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators using special representations of Double Affine Hecke Algebras (DAHAs).
In the work [27] the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operator related to the root system R=AN-1 appeared as the relativistic version of quantum Calogero-Moser system, this operator has the form(1.1)H=∑i=1N∏j=1j≠iNexi-exj+ηexi-exjTxiℏ, where Txiℏ=eℏ∂xi is the shift operator and η,ℏ are parameters.
Macdonald derived and considered operator (1.1) and its generalizations for any root system and (quasi-)minuscule coweight in the context of multi-variable orthogonal polynomials [25].
Commutative algebras of difference operators containing the operators constructed by Macdonald were realized by Cherednik with the help of his DAHA and its polynomial representation [5,8].
These algebras are centralizers of the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators in the algebras of Weyl-invariant difference operators [22].
The whole area of DAHA is a very rich mathematical subject with deep connections and interactions with combinatorics, theory of (quantum) symmetric spaces, representation theory, noncommutative geometry [9].
The first generalization of the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operator which is not directly associated to a root system was found by Chalykh [2].
The operator is a difference version of the Hamiltonian which describes interaction of the system of Calogero-Moser particles of two possible masses [4].
The approach of [2] (see also [3]) is based on the multidimensional Baker-Akhiezer functions, in this case all but one particles have equal masses.
The generalization of Chalykhʼs operator to the system of N1+N2 particles of two types was introduced by Sergeev and Veselov [29], the corresponding operator has the form(1.2)HN1,N2=∑i=1N1∏j=1j≠iN1exi-exj+ηexi-exj∏ℓ=1N2exi-eyℓ+ℏexi-eyℓTxiℏ+eℏ-1eη-1∑ℓ=1N2∏i=1N1eyℓ-exi+ηeyℓ-exi∏m=1m≠ℓN2eyℓ-eym+ℏeyℓ-eymTyℓη.
In the work [29] the operator (1.2) was obtained from the action of the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operator (1.1) extended to the space of symmetric functions in the infinite number of variables with subsequent restriction of the operator (1.1) to the special discriminant subvariety.
Further rational generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators were derived in [12,30] starting from the generalized Calogero-Moser systems and using the bispectrality.
In the present work we develop a uniform approach to the generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems based on the special representations of DAHAs.
DAHA can be associated to any affine root system [25].
The main cases are DAHA of type Rˆ and of type Rˆ∨ where R is a reduced irreducible root system, Rˆ is its affinization and Rˆ∨ denotes the dual affine root system (see Cherednikʼs papers [7] and [5] respectively), and DAHA of type (Cn∨,Cn) (see [26,28]).
The original Cherednikʼs construction [5,7] allowed to obtain Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems for any root system R from the polynomial representation of the corresponding DAHA.
The difference operators from the commutative algebra are obtained by the averaging of the Cherednik-Dunkl operators over the Weyl group with subsequent restriction of the result to the space of invariant polynomials.
In [26] Noumi generalized the construction for the (Cn∨,Cn) case which allowed to obtain commutative algebra containing the Koornwinder operator [21].
In order to obtain generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems we first specialize DAHA-invariant ideals in the polynomial representation, these ideals consist of functions vanishing on certain collections of planes.
Then the action of the invariant combinations of Cherednik-Dunkl operators is defined on the functions on these planes.
Upon restriction to Weyl group invariants we obtain commutative algebras of difference operators.
In this way we recover operator (1.2) (under assumption that ℏ/η∈Z) for the case of DAHA of type A and derive further known and new generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators starting from other root systems.
Similar approach to the generalized Calogero-Moser systems was developed by one of the authors in [13].
It is based on finding special ideals invariant under the rational Cherednik algebras with subsequent restriction of invariant combinations of Dunkl operators thus generalizing Heckmanʼs construction of the usual Calogero-Moser systems [16].
The idea to describe submodules of the polynomial representations of DAHAs by vanishing conditions was very successfully used by Kasatani in [18,19] (see also discussion in the introduction of [10] where the polynomial representation is studied from another perspective).
Thus in the work [18] a filtration of the polynomial representation in type A by the ideals given by vanishing ("wheel") conditions was introduced so that it provides composition factors of the polynomial module (see also [11]).
The paper [19] deals with the polynomial representation of DAHA associated to the affine root system (Cn∨,Cn).
Ideals in the ring of symmetric polynomials invariant under the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operator (1.1) were earlier defined by wheel conditions in [15].
Submodules in the polynomial representations exist at special relations between parameters of the DAHAs.
Therefore the generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators which we obtain carry these restrictions.
This is different from the type A construction of [29] where the authors work in the space of symmetric functions in infinitely many variables and consider some invariant ideals in that algebra.
Nevertheless, for the classical series of root systems one can consider polynomial representations for different ranks of root systems and the respective invariant submodules so that the resulting operators coincide.
That is one obtains operators at some integral restriction on the parameters but the corresponding integral values can be chosen arbitrarily and the operators do not depend on these values.
This allows to omit these restrictions and to continue the commuting families of the resulting operators into the general parameters.
In type An this leads to the operator (1.2) and its quantum integrals.
In type (Cn∨,Cn) this leads to the generalizations of Koornwinder and van Diejen operators.
The structure of the paper is as follows.
In Section 2 we recall Cherednikʼs construction of the commutative algebra of difference operators using DAHA of type Rˆ.
In Section 3 we introduce arrangements of planes D corresponding to subsets S0 of the set of simple roots of the root system R and we define ideals of functions ID vanishing on these planes.
Our first main result (Theorem 3.3) states that for the special geometry of S0 and for the related choice of parameters for DAHA the ideals ID are DAHA-invariant.
The arising arrangements D are shifted versions of the linear arrangements appearing in the study of invariant ideals for the rational Cherednik algebras [13].
In Section 3.4 we construct further invariant ideals given by vanishing conditions where we allow parallel planes.
This generalizes construction of such ideals for DAHA for classical root systems from [18,19].
In Section 4 we present our next main result (Theorem 4.1) which explains how commutative algebras of difference operators arise in the quotients of the polynomial representations by the above ideals ID.
We show in Section 4.2 that these algebras contain complete sets of algebraically independent operators.
We verify in Section 4.3 that in type A we obtain operators (1.2).
We also construct explicitly a complete set of commuting operators for (1.2) (Theorem 4.5).
We consider further examples illustrating the approach in Sections 4.4, 4.5.
Thus we demonstrate that starting from the Macdonald operator of type B we obtain trigonometric version of the operators known from [30,12].
Subsystems in the exceptional root systems provide new families of commutative algebras, we demonstrate this by getting a restricted operator starting from the Macdonald operator for the root system R=F4.
In Section 5 we extend our constructions for the (Cn∨,Cn) DAHA.
We specify invariant ideals in the polynomial representation by imposing vanishing condition on suitable arrangements of planes (Theorem 5.2).
These submodules correspond to the intersections of the submodules investigated in [19].
We introduce generalized Koornwinder operator and derive it as a restriction of the Koornwinder operator in Propositions 5.4, 5.5.
This operator depends on six parameters like the original Koornwinder operator, and also it reflects that there are interacting particles of two types.
Although the restriction construction imposes some integrality relation(s) on the parameters we show that the operator can be embedded into a large commutative algebra of difference operators for any values of the parameters.
In Theorem 5.7 we find a complete set of quantum integrals in the explicit form.
This generalizes van Diejenʼs quantum integrals for the Koornwinder operator [31].
In Section 6 we present our constructions for DAHA of type Rˆ∨ [5].
The invariant ideals are specified in Theorem 6.1.
Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems from DAHA
In this section we recall the construction of the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems from the Cherednik-Dunkl operators.
We consider here DAHAs of type Rˆ (other cases will be considered in Sections 5, 6 and Appendix A).
Following [7-9,20] we define DAHA for the Rˆ case, then we define the Cherednik-Dunkl operators as elements of DAHA acting in the polynomial representation and describe the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems in these terms.
Double Affine Hecke Algebra
Let R⊂Rn⊂V=Cn be an irreducible reduced root system of rank n.
Let (⋅,⋅) be the standard bilinear symmetric non-degenerated form in V and let β∨=2β/(β,β).
We have (α,β∨)∈Z for all α,β∈R.
Consider the orthogonal reflections sα corresponding to the roots α∈R, they act on x∈V as sα(x)=x-(α,x)α∨.
The group W generated by the orthogonal reflections sα, α∈R, is a Weyl group.
Let R+ be a set of positive roots and Δ={α1,…,αn}⊂R+ be the set of simple roots.
The reflections sα1,…,sαn generate the Weyl group W.
Let us introduce lattices of coroots, of coweights and of weights:(2.1)Q∨=⨁i=1nZαi∨,P∨=⨁i=1nZbi,P=⨁i=1nZωi, where bi and ωi are fundamental coweights and fundamental weights:(2.2)(αi,bj)=δij,(ωi,αj∨)=δij.
Introduce also the subsets of dominant and anti-dominant coweights:P+∨={λ∈P∨|(α,λ)≥0,∀α∈R+},P-∨={λ∈P∨|(α,λ)≤0,∀α∈R+}.
Let Vˆ be the space of affine functionals on V.
Each functional α∈Vˆ acts on x∈V as α(x)=(α(1),x)+α(0), where α(1)∈V and α(0)∈C, we write α=[α(1),α(0)] in this case.
The roots γ∈R can be considered as elements of Vˆ acting as γ(x)=(γ,x).
Define the bilinear form on the space Vˆ by the formula (α,β)=(α(1),β(1)), where α=[α(1),α(0)], β=[β(1),β(0)], and α∨=2α(α,α)=[2α(1)(α(1),α(1)),2α(0)(α(1),α(1))] for any α=[α(1),α(0)]∈Vˆ.
The reflection sα corresponding to α=[α(1),α(0)]∈Vˆ is the following affine map: sα(x)=x-α(x)(α(1))∨.
It is the orthogonal reflection with respect to the hyperplane H(α)={x∈V|α(x)=0}.
The action sα on V induces the action on Vˆ given by the formula sα(β)=β-(β,α∨)α, where α,β∈Vˆ.
Let ℏ∈C be a non-zero complex parameter.
Introduce the functional α0=[-θ,ℏ], where θ∈R is the maximal root for R with respect to the basis Δ.
For λ∈V denote by τ(λ) the shift operator τ(λ)x=x+ℏλ, ∀x∈V.
Affine Weyl group W˜ is generated by the reflections sα, with α=[α(1),α(0)] such that α(1)∈R and α(0)∈ℏZ.
The set Rˆ={[α(1),ℏk]|α(1)∈R,k∈Z} is the affine root system corresponding to the root system R [23].
The group τ(Q∨) is a normal subgroup in W˜ and W˜=W⋉τ(Q∨).
The group W˜ is generated by the reflections s0,s1,…,sn, where si=sαi for i=0,1,…,n, (see [17]).
The subset Δ˜={α0,α1,…,αn}⊂Rˆ is a basis of Vˆ called the set of affine simple roots.
For 0≤i,j≤n, i≠j we denote by mij=mji the order (finite or infinite) of the element sisj∈W˜.
Extended affine Weyl group is defined as Wˆ=W⋉τ(P∨) with the commutation relations wτ(λ)=τ(wλ)w, where w∈W, λ∈P∨.
The action of the group Wˆ on V induces the following linear action on the space Vˆ:(2.3)wτ(λ)(α)=[w(α(1)),α(0)-ℏ(α(1),λ)], where w∈W, λ∈P∨, α=[α(1),α(0)].
Let Π={π∈Wˆ|πΔ˜=Δ˜}⊂Wˆ be a subgroup of elements preserving the set of simple affine roots.
Then Wˆ=Π⋉W˜.
The group Π is finite: Π={πr|r∈O}, where O⊂{0,1,…,n} and each element πr is uniquely determined by the condition πr(α0)=αr.
They have the form π0=1, πr=τ(br)ur-1 for r∈O′, where O′=O\{0} and ur∈W are transformations preserving the set {-θ,α1,…,αn} and satisfying ur(αr)=-θ.
The corresponding fundamental coweights br form the entire set of minuscule coweights, that is {br|r∈O′}={λ∈P∨|0≤(α,λ)≤1,∀α∈R+}.
Let Pˆ={μ=[μ(1),μ(0)]|μ(1)∈P,μ(0)∈ℏϵ0Z}⊂Vˆ, where ϵ0 is an integer such that (P,P∨)⊂ϵ0-1Z.
We consider the weight lattice P as a sublattice of Pˆ.
Now we define DAHA corresponding to the affine system Rˆ.
Let t:Rˆ→C\{0} be a Wˆ-invariant function on Rˆ, that is tβ=twˆ(β), for all β∈Rˆ, wˆ∈Wˆ, where we denote tβ=t(β).
We also denote ti=tαi for i=0,1,…,n, these values uniquely determine the function t.
Let q=eℏ/2.
We will assume that ℏ∉πiQ, so q is not a root of unity.
Definition 2.1
([7], see also [20].) Double Affine Hecke Algebra (for Rˆ case) is defined as the algebra t=ℏ,tRˆ generated by the elements T0,T1,…,Tn, by the set of pairwise commuting elements {Xμ}μ∈Pˆ, and by the group Π={πr|r∈O} with the relations(2.4)XμXμ′=Xμ+μ′,μ,μ′∈Pˆ;(2.5)Xν=q2s=eℏs,ν=[0,ℏs]∈Pˆ,s∈ϵ0-1Z;(2.6)(Ti-ti)(Ti+ti-1)=0;(2.7)TiTjTi…︸mijfactors=TjTiTj…︸mijfactors,if i≠j and mij<∞;(2.8)πrTiπr-1=Tj,if πr(αi)=αj,r∈O;(2.9)Ti-1XμTi-1=Xμ-αi,if (μ,αi∨)=1,μ∈Pˆ;(2.10)TiXμ=XμTi,if (μ,αi∨)=0,μ∈Pˆ;(2.11)πrXμπr-1=Xπr(μ),r∈O,μ∈Pˆ; where i,j=0,1,…,n.
Note that the generators T0,T1,…,Tn, Xμ, πr of the algebra t are invertible elements.
We define an element Twˆ∈t for each element wˆ∈Wˆ according to its reduced expression:(2.12)Twˆ=πrTi1…Til,for wˆ=πrsi1…sil, where l=l(wˆ) is the length of wˆ∈Wˆ: l(wˆ)=|Rˆ-∩wˆRˆ+|, where Rˆ+=-Rˆ-=R+∪{[α,ℏk]|α∈R,k∈Z>0}.
In particular, Tπr=πr and Tsi=Ti.
For wˆ,vˆ∈Wˆ one has the relation(2.13)Tvˆwˆ=TvˆTwˆ,if l(vˆwˆ)=l(vˆ)+l(wˆ).
Since for the fundamental coweights we have l(τ(bi+bj))=l(τ(bi))+l(τ(bj)) it leads to Tτ(bi)Tτ(bj)=Tτ(bj)Tτ(bi) for all i,j=1,…,n.
Let us define the commutative family of elements Yλ for λ∈P∨:(2.14)Yλ=∏i=1n(Tτ(bi))mi,if λ=∑i=1nmibi,mi∈Z.
They span a subalgebra C[Y] of t isomorphic to C[P∨] and they satisfy the relations (see [20])(2.15)YλYλ′=Yλ+λ′,λ,λ′∈P∨;(2.16)TiYλ-YsiλTi=(ti-ti-1)Yλ-Ysiλ1-Y-αi∨,λ∈P∨, where i=1,…,n.
These formulae imply that the generators T1,…,Tn commute with the elements of the subalgebra C[Y]W⊂C[Y] consisting of the polynomials invariant under the usual action w:Yλ↦Ywλ of the Weyl group W.
Denote by C∞(V)2πiQ∨ the space of smooth periodic functions f:V→C with the lattice of periods 2πiQ∨, that is f(x+2πiαj∨)=f(x) for j=1,…,n.
Let(2.17)F={f∈C∞(V)2πiQ∨|f is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of Z}, where Z:={x∈V|α(x)∈2πiZ for some α∈Rˆ}.
The space F is Wˆ-invariant with respect to the action(2.18)wˆf(x)=f(wˆ-1x),wˆ∈Wˆ,f∈F,x∈V.
The elements of the algebra t can be represented as operators acting in F:(2.19)Xμ=eμ(x),πr=πr,Ti=ti-ti-11-e-αi(x)+ti-1-tie-αi(x)1-e-αi(x)si, where μ∈Pˆ, r∈O, i=0,1,…,n.
In order to show that Tif∈F for all f∈F and i=0,1,…,n we first rearrange the formula for Ti into the form(2.20)Ti=ti+ti-1-tie-αi(x)1-e-αi(x)(si-1).
Then we note that the function g(x)=f(x)-f(six)=f(x)-f(x-αi(x)(αi(1))∨) belongs to F and vanishes whenever αi(x)∈2πiZ.
Hence the function g˜(x)=g(x)1-e-αi(x) is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of Z and smooth everywhere.
So that g˜∈F and the function(2.21)Tif(x)=tif(x)+(ti-1-tie-αi(x))g˜(x) also belongs to F.
The formulae (2.19) define a faithful representation of DAHA t on the space F called polynomial representation (extended to smooth functions).
The elements Yλ in this representation are called Cherednik-Dunkl operators.
Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems
Denote by FW the subspace of invariant functions f∈F, that is f(wx)=f(x) for all w∈W and x∈V.
Consider the subalgebra C[Y]W⊂C[Y]⊂t.
It is spanned as a vector space by the elements(2.22)mλ(Y)=∑ν∈WλYν=1|Wλ|∑w∈WYwλ, where Wλ={wλ|w∈W} is the orbit of the coweight λ∈P∨ and Wλ={w∈W|wλ=λ} is the stabilizer of λ.
We will normally be choosing λ∈P-∨ for the operators mλ(Y).
In the representation (2.19) the elements mλ(Y) have the form(2.23)mλ(Y)=∑ν∈P∨∑w∈Wgν,wλ(x)τ(ν)w, where gν,wλ(x) are some meromorphic functions and τ(ν) are the shift operators acting on functions by τ(ν)f(x)=f(x-ℏν).
The subspace FW⊂F can be characterized as a space annihilated by all the operators T1-t1,…,Tn-tn.
Since the elements of C[Y]W commute with T1,…,Tn they preserve this subspace: mλ(Y)(FW)⊂FW.
Thus we can restrict the elements of C[Y]W to FW [5,6].
The restriction of (2.23) is(2.24)Mλ=Res(mλ(Y))=mλ(Y)|FW=∑ν∈P∨∑w∈Wgν,wλ(x)τ(ν).
Let Mer(V) be the space of meromorphic functions φ(x) on V such that φ(x+2πiαj∨)=φ(x) for all j=1,…,n.
Define the subspace M⊂Mer(V) consisting of functions φ∈Mer(V) holomorphic out of the union of hyperplanes ⋃β∈Rˆ{x∈V|β(x)∈2πiZ}.
Consider the smash-product algebra D=M#C[τ(P∨)] defined by the commutation relation τ(λ)φ(x)=φ(x-ℏλ)τ(λ).
This is the algebra of difference operators acting on the space M. Any element a∈D has the form a=∑λ∈P∨∑w∈Wgλ,w(x)τ(λ)w, where gλ,w∈M and the sum over λ is finite.
Note that Mλ∈D for any λ∈P∨.
Let r∈O′, so br∈P∨ is a minuscule coweight.
Then the restriction of m-br(Y) to FW can be written explicitly [5,8,25]:(2.25)M-br=∑λ∈W(-br)(∏α∈R(α,λ)=1tαe(α,x)-tα-1e(α,x)-1)τ(λ)(2.26)M-br=∑λ∈W(-br)(∏α∈R(α,λ)=1tαe(α,x)-tα-1e(α,x)-1)(τ(λ)-1)+m-br,t, where mλ,t=∑ν∈Wλ∏α∈R+tα(α,ν).
Note that in the cases R=E8, F4, G2 the minuscule coweights do not exist.
For any R there exists quasi-minuscule coweight λ=-θ∨.
The corresponding operator has the form [8,25]:(2.27)M-θ∨=∑β∈Wθ(∏α∈R(α,β∨)>0tαe(α,x)-tα-1e(α,x)-1)q-1t0e(β,x)-qt0-1q-1e(β,x)-q(τ(β∨)-1)+m-θ∨,t.
The operators (2.25), (2.27) are called Macdonald operators (see e.g. [24]).
Consider the subspace R⊂D spanned by the elements Mλ defined by (2.24).
Since the restriction operation Res:mλ(Y)↦Mλ is an algebra homomorphism the subspace R=Res(C[Y]W) is a commutative subalgebra in D.
We will recall that R contains n algebraically independent elements.
First we introduce some notations.
For each λ∈P∨ there exists a unique dominant coweight λ+∈P+∨ such that λ+∈Wλ.
Let ν,λ∈P∨ be two coweights.
We write ν>λ if ν≠λ and ν-λ=∑j=1nkjαj∨ for some kj∈Z≥0.
We also introduce another order on P∨: we write ν≺λ if ν+<λ+ or (ν+=λ+ and ν>λ) (see [20]).
As it is explained in [20] the Cherednik-Dunkl operators have the form(2.28)Yλ=∑w∈Wg˜wλ(x)τ(λ)w+∑ν≺λ∑w∈Wg˜ν,wλ(x)τ(ν)w, for some functions g˜ν,wλ(x), g˜wλ(x).
For an anti-dominant coweight λ∈P-∨ one has a more exact formula [20](2.29)Yλ=gλ(x)τ(λ)+∑ν≺λ∑w∈Wg˜ν,wλ(x)τ(ν)w.
Here gλ(x)=∏α∈Rˆλtαeα(x)-tα-1eα(x)-1, where Rˆλ=Rˆ-∩(τ(λ)Rˆ+) is a subset in Rˆ.
Thus, for any λ∈P-∨ we obtain(2.30)mλ(Y)=gλ(x)τ(λ)+∑ν≺λ∑w∈Wgν,wλ(x)τ(ν)w for some functions g˜ν,wλ(x).
In accordance with the formula (2.24) the restriction of (2.30) to the subspace FW gives the following difference operator(2.31)Mλ=gλ(x)τ(λ)+∑ν≺λgνλ(x)τ(ν), where gνλ(x)=∑w∈Wgν,wλ(x).
Since in the case λ∈P-∨ the condition ν≺λ implies ν>λ we can replace the order ≺ with the order > in the sum in the formula (2.31).
It follows now that for any m1,…,mn∈Z≥0 one has(2.32)∏j=1n(M-bj)mj=gm1,…,mn(x)τ(λ)+∑ν>λgνm1,…,mn(x)τ(ν), where gm1,…,mn(x)≢0 and λ=-∑i=1nmjbj∈P-∨.
Since the right-hand sides of (2.32) are linearly independent the operators M-b1,…,M-bn are algebraically independent.
Remark 2.1
One can show that the operator (2.32) has the form cλλMλ+∑ν∈P-∨,ν>λcνλMν such that cλλ≠0.
Then [1, VI, §3, 4, Lemma 4] implies that the operators (2.32) form a basis of the space R.
It follows the commutative algebra R is isomorphic to the algebra of polynomials C[z1,…,zn], and the isomorphism can be given by M-bj↦zj.
In particular the elements M-b1,…,M-bn generate the algebra R.
The subalgebra R⊂D is called the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars system.
The Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operator (2.25) or the operator (2.27) can be considered as a Hamiltonian of this system.
Invariant shifted parabolic ideals
The goal of this section is to construct some t-submodules of F, which will be used in the next section.
Note that any ideal of the algebra F is invariant under the action of the generators Xμ∈t.
We define some ideals as the sets of functions vanishing on certain planes.
We show that these ideals are invariant under the actions of other generators of DAHA if parameters satisfy special conditions.
Let η:R→C be a W-invariant function on the irreducible reduced root system R, that is ηw(α)=ηα=η(α), ∀α∈R, ∀w∈W.
We will also denote ηi=ηαi for the simple roots αi.
To each subset S⊂R we associate the plane(3.1)Hη(S)={x∈V|(α,x)=ηα,∀α∈S}=⋂α∈S{x∈V|(α,x)=ηα}.
Note that Hη(wS)=wHη(S) for any w∈W.
Let S0 be a subset of the set of simple roots Δ and let W0⊂W be the subgroup generated by sα, α∈S0.
We associate to S0 the following subset(3.2)W+={w∈W|wS0⊂R+}⊂W.
Let V0=〈S0〉 be the linear subspace of V spanned by the set S0.
Then R0=V0∩R is the root system with the set of simple roots S0.
Note that the transformations w∈W+ restricted to R0 respect the standard order.
More exactly, if β≤γ, β,γ∈R0 then wβ≤wγ.
(Here δ1≤δ2 means δ2-δ1=∑i=1nmiαi, where mi∈Z≥0.)
Remark 3.1
The elements of W+ are the shortest coset representatives of the left cosets of W0 in W (see [17]).
Let us consider the plane(3.3)D0=Hη(S0)={x∈V|(α,x)=ηα,∀α∈S0} and the union of planes(3.4)D=⋃w∈W+Hη(wS0)=W+D0.
The arrangement D is obtained by shifting the linear arrangement WH0(S0), where H0(S0) is defined by the formula (3.3) with the function η≡0.
More exactly, the following two statements take place.
Proposition 3.1
For any w∈W there exists w′∈W+ such that H0(wS0)=H0(w′S0).
Thus each plane wH0(S0) is parallel to some plane w′D0⊂D.
Proof
The element w∈W can be decomposed as w=w′w0 where w′∈W+, w0∈W0 (see [17]).
Since H0(S0)=H0(R0) and w0R0=R0 we have w0H0(S0)=H0(S0).
Hence H0(wS0)=w′w0H0(S0)=w′H0(S0)=H0(w′S0). □
Proposition 3.2
If the planes wD0 and w′D0 are parallel for some w,w′∈W+ then they coincide: wD0=w′D0.
Proof
Let w,w′∈W+.
If the planes wD0 and w′D0 are parallel then wV0=w′V0.
In particular, this implies(3.5)wα=∑β∈S0γαβw′β,for all α∈S0, where γαβ∈C.
Applying (w′)-1 to (3.5) we conclude that γαβ∈Z≥0, ∀β∈S0 or γαβ∈Z≤0, ∀β∈S0.
Taking into account wα∈R+ and w′β∈R+ we deduce from (3.5) that γαβ∈Z≥0, ∀α,β∈S0.
Analogously we have(3.6)w′β=∑α∈S0γ˜βαwα,for all β∈S0, where γ˜βα∈Z≥0.
The formulae (3.5), (3.6) lead to the following system of equations(3.7)∑β∈S0γαβγ˜βα˜=δα,α˜,α,α˜∈S0, where δα,β is the delta-symbol: δα,α=1, δα,β=0 for α≠β.
Under conditions γαβ,γ˜βα∈Z≥0 the general solution of the system (3.7) is(3.8)γαβ=γ˜βα=δσ(α),β, where σ:S0→S0 is a bijection.
Hence(3.9)wα=∑β∈S0δσ(α),βw′β=w′σ(α),for all α∈S0.
Using this one yieldswD0={x∈V|(wα,x)=ηα,∀α∈S0}={x∈V|(w′σ(α),x)=ηα,∀α∈S0}={x∈V|(w′σ(α),x)=ησ(α),∀α∈S0}={x∈V|(w′α,x)=ηα,∀α∈S0}=w′D0, where we used ηα=ησ(α) obtained from (3.9). □
Let R1,…,Rm be irreducible components of R0=V0∩R, R0=⨆ℓ=1mRℓ.
In each root subsystem Rℓ we have the corresponding set of simple roots Sℓ=S0∩Rℓ, so that S0=⨆ℓ=1mSℓ, where Sℓ∩Sℓ′=∅ for ℓ≠ℓ′.
The reflections sα, α∈Rℓ, generate the Weyl group Wℓ⊂W corresponding to the root system Rℓ.
For each root system Rℓ there exists the maximal root θℓ∈Rℓ with respect to Sℓ.
Let kℓ=|Sℓ| and Sℓ={α1ℓ,α2ℓ,…,αkℓℓ}, then θℓ=∑j=1kℓnjℓαjℓ, where njℓ≥1 are integers.
Definition 3.1
Let θ=∑i=1nniαi be the maximal root of R with respect to the set of simple roots Δ.
The numberhη=ηθ+∑i=1nniηαi is called generalized Coxeter number for the root system R and the invariant function η.
We note that the generalized Coxeter number for the root system R does not depend on the choice of R+ (or, equivalently, on the choice of Δ).
For a constant function ηα≡η the generalized Coxeter number hη=η⋅h, where h=1+∑i=1nni is the usual Coxeter number (see [1]).
Remark 3.2
The generalized Coxeter number can be equivalently defined as the coefficient of proportionality of the following W-invariant inner products (cf. [13]):(3.10)∑α∈Rηα(α,u)(α,v)(α,α)=hη⋅(u,v),∀u,v∈V.
Note that the restriction of the function η:R→C to the subsystems Rℓ⊂R is a Wℓ-invariant function on Rℓ.
Since Rℓ is irreducible one can define the generalized Coxeter numbers for this subsystem:(3.11)hηℓ=ηθℓ+∑j=1kℓnjℓηjℓ, where ηjℓ=ηαjℓ.
Define the ideal of functions vanishing on the union of planes (3.4):(3.12)ID={f∈F|f(x)=0,∀x∈D}.
The main result of this section is the following theorem.
Theorem 3.3
Suppose that the subsystem S0⊂Δ and the function η are such that(3.13)hηℓ=ℏ,for all ℓ=1,…,m.
Let the parameters of DAHA t satisfy tα2=eηα for all α∈R.
Then the ideal ID⊂F is invariant under the action of DAHA: tID⊂ID.
We will prove this theorem in the next tree subsections.
We establish the invariance under Ti, 1≤i≤n in Section 3.1, the invariance under πr is established in Section 3.2 and the invariance under T0 is established in Section 3.3.
Remark 3.3
The degenerations of the ideals ID at η→0 give invariant parabolic ideals for the rational Cherednik algebra Hc(W) with c=η/ℏ.
Any radical ideal invariant under Hc(W) can be obtained this way (see [13]).
Remark 3.4
The invariant ideals ID for the A series are the ideals obtained by Kasatani in [18], namely these are the ideals Im(k,r) with r=2 and the same m as we use.
(The ideals in [18] are considered in the space of polynomials of multiplicative variables.)
Let us record the introduced planes in terms of affine functionals.
For a root α∈R+ we denote α′=[α,-ηα]∈Vˆ.
Note that w(α′)=[wα,-ηα]=[wα,-ηwα]=(wα)′ for all w∈W+, α∈R+.
For a subset S⊂Vˆ let(3.14)H(S)={x∈V|β(x)=0,∀β∈S}.
We will write H(β1,β2,…) instead of H({β1,β2,…}).
In these notations the definitions (3.1) and (3.4) take the form(3.15)Hη(S)=H(S′)={x∈V|α′(x)=0,∀α∈S},D=⋃w∈W+H(wS0′), where S′={α′|α∈S}, S0′={α′|α∈S0}.
Note also that wH(S′)=H(wS′).
Invariance under T1,…,Tn
Lemma 3.4
Let S=wS0 where S0⊂Δ, and w∈W+.
Let β∈Δ.
If β∉S then β cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the elements of S.
Proof
Suppose that there exist numbers γα∈C for α∈S0 such that β=∑α∈S0γαwα.
Then, w-1(β)=∑α∈S0γαα.
Since S0⊂Δ this equation implies that the numbers γα are integers with the same sign: γα′≥0, ∀α∈S0 or γα′≤0, ∀α∈S0.
Taking into account that wα∈R+ for any α∈S0 we see that the relation β=∑α∈S0γαwα holds only if β∈S, but this contradicts the condition of the lemma. □
Proposition 3.5
Let parameters of DAHA t satisfy tα2=eηα for all α∈R.
Then the ideal ID given by (3.12), (3.4), (3.3) is invariant under the action of the operators T1,…,Tn, moreover TiID=ID for all i=1,…,n.
Proof
Let f∈ID.
Consider the subset S=wS0⊂R+, where w∈W+.
We need to prove that the function Tif(x) vanishes on the plane H(S′).
Consider first the case αi∈S.
Consider the expression (2.21) for the function Tif(x).
Let x∈H(S′), then the first term in this expression vanishes since the function f(x) vanishes on the plane H(S′) and the second term vanishes since ti-1-tie-αi(x)=ti-1-tie-ηi=0.
Now consider the case αi∉S.
Then we have si(S)⊂R+.
This means that siw∈W+, siH(S′)=H(siwS0′)⊂D and f(six)=0 whenever x∈H(S′).
Thus, if x∈H(S′) and e-αi(x)≠1 then both terms in(3.16)Tif(x)=ti-ti-11-e-αi(x)f(x)+ti-1-tie-αi(x)1-e-αi(x)f(six) vanish: Tif(x)=0.
Note that for any p∈Z the intersection of the planes H(S′) and H([αi,2πip]) has positive codimension in H(S′).
Indeed, otherwise H(S′)⊂H([αi,2πip]) and this implies, in particular, that αi can be obtained as a linear combination of the elements of S, but this is impossible by Lemma 3.4.
Thus the subset {x∈H(S′)|e-αi(x)≠1} is everywhere dense in the plane H(S′).
Since the function Tif(x) is continuous it vanishes on the whole plane: Tif(x)=0, ∀x∈H(S′).
We have proved TiID⊂ID.
The relation Ti-1=Ti+(ti-1-ti) implies Ti-1ID⊂ID and then TiID=ID. □
Remark 3.5
If the W-invariant function η:R→C is fixed then one can choose a Wˆ-invariant function t:Rˆ→C satisfying the conditions of Proposition 3.5 by the formula t[β,ℏk]=eηβ/2 for all β∈R and k∈Z.
Invariance under the group Π
Lemma 3.6
(Cf. [1].) Let θ=∑i=1nniαi be the maximal root of R with respect to the set of simple roots Δ.
Then nr=1 for some r if and only if there exists ur∈W such that ur({-θ}∪Δ)={-θ}∪Δ and ur(αr)=-θ.
Furthermore, if ur(αi)=αj then ni=nj.
Proof
In the notations of Section 2.1 the statement means O′={r|nr=1} and it is proved in [1].
Now let r∈O′.
Define the number r⁎∈O′ such that πr⁎=πr-1, then ur⁎=ur-1, which leads to ur(-θ)=αr⁎.
Taking into account that ur(αr)=-θ, ur(αi)=αj, nr=1 and ur(Δ\{αr})=Δ\{αr⁎}, we rearrange ur(-∑i=1nniαi)=αr⁎ asniαj+∑k≠j,r⁎nn˜kαk-∑k=1nnkαk+αr⁎=0, where n˜k∈Z.
We obtain ni=nj since j≠r⁎ by extracting the coefficient at αj. □
Proposition 3.7
Suppose that the subsystem S0⊂Δ and the function η are such that hηℓ=ℏ for all ℓ=1,…,m.
Then the arrangement (3.4) and the ideal (3.12) satisfy πrD=D and πrID=ID for any r∈O.
Proof
It is sufficient to establish that πr-1D⊂D for any r∈O′.
Consider the subset wS0⊂R+, where w∈W+.
We will show that there exists w˜∈W+ such that πr-1H(wS0′)=H(w˜S0′).
First we note that(3.17)if α∈R+ and (α,br)=0 then urα∈R+.
Indeed since the transformation πr-1 preserves the set Δ˜ it also preserves the set Rˆ+.
Therefore urα=πr-1α∈Rˆ+∩R=R+, where we used ur=πr-1τ(br) and urα∈R.
Lemma 3.6 and r∈O′ imply nr=1.
Since the roots wαjℓ and wθℓ=∑j=1kℓnjℓwαjℓ are positive and coweight br is minuscule the products (wθℓ,br) and (wαjℓ,br) are equal to 0 or 1.
So for each ℓ one of the following two possibilities holds:(i)
(wθℓ,br)=1, hence (wαjℓ,br)=δjpℓ and npℓℓ=1 for some pℓ such that 1≤pℓ≤kℓ;
(ii)
(wθℓ,br)=0, hence (wαjℓ,br)=0 for all j=1,…,kℓ.
 We can fix pℓ=1 by renumbering the roots α1ℓ,…,αkℓℓ if necessary.
Consider first the case (i): γrjℓ=δj1 and n1ℓ=1.
Let us first rearrange the plane H(wSℓ′) as follows.
We can replace inH(wSℓ′)=H([wα1ℓ,-η1ℓ],[wα2ℓ,-η2ℓ],…,[wαkℓℓ,-ηkℓℓ]) the functional [wα1ℓ,-η1ℓ] by the linear combination ∑j=1kℓnjℓ[-wαjℓ,ηjℓ]; so taking into account wθℓ=∑j=1kℓnjℓwαjℓ and the formula (3.11) we obtain(3.18)H(wSℓ′)=H([-wθℓ,hηℓ-ηθℓ],[wα2ℓ,-η2ℓ],…,[wαkℓℓ,-ηkℓℓ]).
This gives(3.19)πr-1H(wSℓ′)=H([-urwθℓ,hηℓ-ηθℓ-ℏ],[urwα2ℓ,-η2ℓ],…,[urwαkℓℓ,-ηkℓℓ]) using πr-1=urτ(-br) and urτ(-br)α=[urα(1),α(0)+ℏ(α(1),br)], where α=[α(1),α(0)]∈Vˆ.
It follows from (3.17) that urwαjℓ∈R+ for j=2,…,kℓ.
We note that -urwθℓ∈R+ since (urwθℓ,urbr)=1 and urbr∈P-∨.
The latter property is proved as follows.
Since Π is a group there exists r⁎∈O′ such that πr-1=πr⁎.
Rearranging πr=πr⁎-1 as τ(br)ur-1=ur⁎τ(-br⁎) we obtain urbr=-br⁎∈P-∨, where we used the relation urτ(br)ur-1=τ(urbr).
Since n1ℓ=1 it follows by Lemma 3.6 applied to the root system Rℓ that there exists an element vℓ∈Wℓ such that vℓ(Sℓ)={-θℓ,α2ℓ,…,αkℓℓ}.
So using hηℓ=ℏ we obtain(3.20)πr-1H(wSℓ′)=H(urwvℓSℓ′)andurwvℓSℓ⊂R+.
In the case (ii) the formulae (3.20) are valid for vℓ=1.
Indeed πr-1H(wSℓ′)=H(urwSℓ′) and it follows from (3.17) that urwαjℓ∈R+ for all j=1,…,kℓ.
Define now w˜=urw∏ℓ=1mvℓ.
Since vℓ∈Wℓ acts identically on Sℓ′ for ℓ′≠ℓ we derive(3.21)w˜S0=⋃ℓ=1murwvℓSℓ⊂R+, hence w˜∈W+, and(3.22)πr-1H(wS0′)=⋂ℓ=1mπr-1H(wSℓ′)=⋂ℓ=1mH(urwvℓSℓ′)=H(⋃ℓ=1murwvℓSℓ′)=H(w˜S0′).
Thus the invariance of D and, as consequence, the invariance of ID are proven. □
Invariance under T0
If O≠{0} then there exists r∈O′ and the invariance of ID under T0 follows from the formula T0=πr-1Trπr.
Otherwise (O={0} for R=E8, F4, G2) we need to prove the invariance under T0 separately.
We will prove it in the general case.
We start with two preliminary lemmas.
Lemma 3.8
Let w∈W+.
Suppose the maximal roots for the system R and the subsystem Rℓ for some ℓ satisfy wθℓ≠θ.
Then θ∉wRℓ.
Proof
Suppose θ∈wRℓ and let β=w-1θ.
Then β∈Rℓ hence β≤θℓ.
Since w∈W+ and β,θℓ∈R0 it follows θ=wβ≤wθℓ (see the comment after the formula (3.2)).
Since θ is the maximal root we get θ=wθℓ, which is a contradiction. □
Lemma 3.9
Suppose the subsystem S0⊂Δ and the function η are such that hηℓ=ℏ for all ℓ=1,…,m.
Let w∈W+ and suppose wθℓ≠θ for all ℓ=1,…,m.
Then s0H(wS0′)⊂D.
Proof
We will prove the existence of an element w˜∈W+ such that s0H(wS0′)=H(w˜S0′).
First we note that Lemma 3.8 implies θ≠wαjℓ for all j=1,…,kℓ, ℓ=1,…,m.
Recall that if α∈R+ and α≠θ then (α,θ∨) equals 0 or 1 (see [1]).
Since wθℓ=∑j=1kℓnjℓwαjℓ≠θ there are only two possibilities for each ℓ:(i)
(wθℓ,θ∨)=1 and hence (wαjℓ,θ∨)=δjlℓ, npℓℓ=1 for some pℓ such that 1≤pℓ≤kℓ;
(ii)
(wθℓ,θ∨)=0 and hence (wαjℓ,θ∨)=0 for all j=1,…,kℓ.
 Here we took into account that wθℓ,wαjℓ∈R+.
Consider the case (i).
We can assume pℓ=1.
Rewriting H(wSℓ′) as (3.18) and acting to this plane by s0=sθτ(-θ∨) one yields(3.23)s0H(wSℓ′)=H([-sθwθℓ,hηℓ-ηθℓℓ-ℏ],[sθwα2ℓ,-η2ℓ],…,[sθwαkℓℓ,-ηkℓℓ]).
Taking into account that sθ(α)=α-(α,θ∨)θ, ∀α∈R, we conclude sθwαjℓ=wαjℓ∈R+ for j=2,…,kℓ and -sθwθℓ=θ-wθℓ∈R+.
Since n1ℓ=1 there exists vℓ∈Wℓ such that vℓ(Sℓ)={-θℓ,α2ℓ,…,αkℓℓ} (due to Lemma 3.6).
Then the condition hηℓ=ℏ implies(3.24)s0H(wSℓ′)=H(sθwvℓSℓ′),sθwvℓSℓ⊂R+.
In the case (ii) the formulae (3.24) are valid for vℓ=1, because in this case s0wαjℓ=sθwαjℓ=wαjℓ∈R+ for all j=1,…,kℓ.
Thus we have s0H(wS0′)=H(w˜S0′), where w˜=sθw∏ℓ=1mvℓ∈W+. □
Now the invariance of the ideal ID under the action of the operator T0 can be established.
Proposition 3.10
Suppose the subsystem S0⊂Δ and the functions η, t satisfy hηℓ=ℏ for all ℓ=1,…,m and t02=eηθ.
Then T0ID=ID.
Proof
We need to prove that for any f∈ID and w∈W+ the function T0f(x) vanishes on the plane H(S′), where S=wS0.
Let us first suppose that wθℓ=θ for some ℓ.
Let x∈H(S′).
Since hηℓ=ℏ and ηθℓ=ηθ one yields α0(x)=-(wθℓ,x)+ℏ=ηθℓ-hηℓ+ℏ=ηθ and hence e-α0(x)=t0-2.
Therefore the right-hand side in (2.21) with i=0 vanishes.
Otherwise wθℓ≠θ for all ℓ and by virtue of Lemma 3.9 we have s0H(S′)⊂D.
Hence the function(3.25)T0f(x)=t0-t0-11-e-α0(x)f(x)+t0-1-t0e-α0(x)1-e-α0(x)f(s0x) vanishes on the subset H(S′)∩{x∈V|e-α0(x)≠1}.
Let us prove that this subset is everywhere dense in H(S′).
Indeed, otherwise H(S′) is contained in a plane H(α0+[0,2πip]) for some p∈Z.
This leads to [-θ,ℏ+2πip]=∑α∈wS0γαα′.
Therefore θ∈wV0, where V0⊂V is the subspace spanned by S0.
Since w-1θ∈R then w-1θ∈R0=V0∩R, and the formula R0=⨆ℓ=1mRℓ implies that w-1θ∈Rℓ for some ℓ.
But this is impossible due to Lemma 3.8.
Thus the continuous function T0f(x) vanishes on all the plane H(S′). □
Theorem 3.3 follows from Propositions 3.5, 3.7, 3.10.
Further invariant ideals
In this subsection we generalize previously constructed ideals ID by requiring functions to vanish on the families of parallel planes containing the planes wD0 with w∈W+.
For DAHA associated with the classical root systems such submodules were considered by Kasatani in [18,19].
Consider a subset wS0⊂R, where w∈W, and its decomposition wS0=⨆ℓ=1mwSℓ.
For a function ξ:wS0→Z≥0 we denote |ξ|ℓw=∑α∈wSℓξ(α), where ℓ=1,…,m.
Note that if wS0=w′S0 for some w′∈W then the values |ξ|1w,…,|ξ|mw and |ξ|1w′,…,|ξ|mw′ are related by |ξ|ℓw′=|ξ|σ(ℓ)w, where a permutation σ∈Sm is such that Rσ(ℓ)≅Rℓ.
Let r1,…,rm∈Z≥0 be such that rℓ=rℓ′ if Rℓ≅Rℓ′.
For an element w∈W we define the following set of functions(3.26)Ξr→(w)={ξ:wS0→Z≥0|ξ-1(0)⊂R+,|ξ|ℓw≤rℓ,ℓ=1,…,m}, where r→=(r1,…,rm).
The condition ξ-1(0)⊂R+ means that ξ(α)=0 implies α∈R+.
Let η:R→C be a fixed W-invariant function.
To a subset S⊂R and a function ξ:S→Z≥0 we associate the plane(3.27)Hη(S;ξ)={x∈V|(α,x)=ηα-ℏξ(α),∀α∈S}.
Starting from the subset S0 and r→ we define the union of planes(3.28)Dr→=⋃w∈W⋃ξ∈Ξr→(w)Hη(wS0;ξ).
We will assume that r→ is such that(3.29)GCD(rℓ+1,kℓ+1)=1,if Rℓ≅Akℓ,ℓ=1,…,m,(3.30)rℓ=0,if Rℓ≇Akℓ,ℓ=1,…,m, where GCD stands for the greatest common divisor.
Note that in the case r→=0 the union Dr→ coincides with D=W+D0 defined by the formula (3.4).
We also generalize the conditions hηℓ=ℏ as(3.31)hηℓ=(rℓ+1)ℏ.
Theorem 3.11
Suppose the parameters of DAHA t satisfy tα2=eηα for all α∈R.
Suppose the subsystem S0⊂Δ, the function η and the parameters r1,…,rm are such that the conditions (3.29), (3.30) and (3.31) are satisfied.
Then the ideal(3.32)IDr→={f∈F|f(x)=0, for all x∈Dr→} where Dr→ is given by (3.28), is invariant under the action of DAHA t.
First we establish the invariance under T1,…,Tn.
Lemma 3.12
Under assumptions of Theorem 3.11 one has TiIDr→⊂IDr→ for i=1,…,n.
Proof
Similar to the proof of Proposition 3.5 we show that the function (Tif)(x) vanishes on the plane Hη(wS0;ξ), where f∈IDr→, w∈W and ξ∈Ξr→(w).
If αi∈ξ-1(0) then it follows vanishing of the function ti-1-tie-αi(x) (see the formula (2.21)).
Suppose now that αi∉ξ-1(0).
It follows si(ξ-1(0))=(ξ∘si)-1(0)⊂R+ and, therefore, ξ∘si∈Ξr→(siw).
If x∈Hη(wS0;ξ) then six∈Hη(siwS0;ξ∘si)⊂Dr→ and the function f(six) vanishes as well as the function f(x).
We are left to prove that Hη(wS0;ξ)⊄H([αi,2πip]) for all p∈Z.
Suppose the opposite, that is αi=∑α∈S0γαwα and 2πip=∑α∈S0γα(ℏξ(wα)-ηα) for some γα∈C and p∈Z.
Since w-1αi=∑α∈S0γαα∈R0, γα are integers of the same sign and there exists ℓ, 1≤ℓ≤m such that w-1αi∈Rℓ.
Therefore 2πip=∑α∈Sℓγα(ℏξ(wα)-ηα).
If rℓ=0 then ξ|wSℓ≡0 hence wSℓ⊂R+ and αi∈wSℓ which is not possible as ξ(αi)≠0.
If rℓ≠0 then Rℓ≅Akℓ, hence η|Rℓ=const and θℓ=∑α∈Sℓα.
Note that ±w-1αi=±∑α∈Sℓα≤θℓ hence |γα|≤1.
The condition (3.31) implies(3.33)2πip=ℏ(∑α∈Sℓγαξ(wα)-rℓ+1kℓ+1∑α∈Sℓγα).
Since ℏ∉2πiQ the expression in the brackets vanishes.
As |∑α∈Sℓγα|=∑α∈Sℓ|γα|≤kℓ we get a contradiction with the condition (3.29). □
We will need the following technical lemma for the rest of the proof of Theorem 3.11.
Lemma 3.13
Let u∈W, λ∈P+∨ such that uλ∈P-∨.
Suppose that uˆR+⊂Rˆ+, where uˆ=uτ(-λ).
Let Rℓ≅Akℓ for some ℓ and let Sℓ={α1ℓ,…,αkℓℓ} be a basis of simple roots.
Assume that w∈W and ξ∈Ξr→(w) satisfy the conditions |ξ|ℓw+m0ℓ≤rℓ+1 and ξjℓ+mjℓ≥0 for all j=1,…,kℓ, where m0ℓ=(wθℓ,λ), ξjℓ=ξ(wαjℓ), mjℓ=(wαjℓ,λ).
Denote ξℓ=ξ|wSℓ.
Then uˆHη(wSℓ;ξℓ)=Hη(uwvℓSℓ;ξ˜ℓ) for some element vℓ∈Wℓ and some map ξ˜ℓ:uwvℓSℓ→Z≥0 such that ∑α∈uwvℓSℓξ˜(α)≤rℓ and ξ˜ℓ-1(0)⊂R+.
Proof
Since Rℓ≅Akℓ the maximal root in Rℓ is θℓ=∑j=1kℓαjℓ and hence m0ℓ=∑j=1kℓmjℓ.
Denoting ζjℓ=ξjℓ+mjℓ we have ζjℓ≥0.
Let us show that(3.34)ζjℓ=0impliesuwαjℓ∈R+.
If ζjℓ=0 there are two cases: ξjℓ=mjℓ=0 and ξjℓ=-mjℓ>0.
Consider the first case.
Note that mjℓ=0 implies that uwαjℓ=uˆwαjℓ.
Since ξjℓ=0 we have wαjℓ∈R+ and using uˆR+⊂Rˆ+ we obtain uwαjℓ∈R∩Rˆ+=R+.
In the case when -mjℓ>0 we have (uwαjℓ,uλ)=mjℓ<0.
Since uλ∈P-∨ we also deduce uwαjℓ∈R+.
There are two possible cases:(i)
|ξ|ℓw+m0ℓ=rℓ+1 and hence m0ℓ≥1;
(ii)
|ξ|ℓw+m0ℓ≤rℓ.
Consider first the case (i).
Since m0ℓ≥1 there exists pℓ, 1≤pℓ≤kℓ such that mpℓℓ≥1.
We can assume pℓ=1, that is m1ℓ≥1.
The formula (3.18) can be generalized in this case as(3.35)Hη(wSℓ;ξℓ)=H([-wθℓ,-ℏ|ξ|ℓw+hηℓ-ηθℓ],[wα2ℓ,ℏξ2ℓ-η2ℓ],…,[wαkℓℓ,ℏξkℓℓ-ηkℓℓ]).
Acting by uˆ=uτ(-λ) and taking into account (3.31) we obtain(3.36)uˆHη(wSℓ;ξℓ)=H([-uwθℓ,-ηθℓ],[uwα2ℓ,ℏζ2ℓ-η2ℓ],…,[uwαkℓℓ,ℏζkℓℓ-ηkℓℓ]).
Due to Lemma 3.6 there exists vℓ∈Wℓ such that {-θℓ,α2ℓ,…,αkℓℓ}=vℓSℓ.
Define the function ξ˜ℓ:uwvℓSℓ→Z≥0 by ξ˜ℓ(-uwθℓ)=0 and ξ˜ℓ(uwαjℓ)=ζjℓ where j=2,…,kℓ.
Let us check that the sum of values of the function ξ˜ℓ is not greater than rℓ.
Indeed, ∑j=2kℓζjℓ=|ξ|ℓw+m0ℓ-ξ1ℓ-m1ℓ=rℓ+1-ξ1ℓ-m1ℓ≤rℓ, where we used m1ℓ≥1.
Since uλ∈P-∨ and (uwθℓ,uλ)=m0ℓ≥1 we have -uwθℓ∈R+.
Taking into account (3.34) we derive ξ˜ℓ-1(0)⊂R+.
In the case (ii) we set vℓ=1 and ξ˜ℓ(uwαjℓ)=ζjℓ where j=1,…,kℓ.
The sum of values of the function ξ˜ℓ is still not greater than rℓ, indeed ∑j=1kℓζjℓ=|ξ|ℓw+m0ℓ≤rℓ.
From (3.34) we derive ξ˜ℓ-1(0)⊂R+ for this case as well.
In both cases we arrive at uˆHη(wSℓ;ξℓ)=Hη(uwvℓSℓ;ξ˜ℓ). □
Now we are ready to establish the invariance of IDr→ under the operators πr and T0.
Lemma 3.14
Let r∈O.
Under assumptions of Theorem 3.11 one has πrIDr→⊂IDr→.
Proof
It is sufficient to establish πr-1Dr→⊂Dr→ for arbitrary r∈O′.
Consider an element w∈W and a function ξ∈Ξr→(w).
We will show that there exists an element w˜∈W and a function ξ∈Ξr→(w˜) such that πr-1Hη(wS0;ξ)=Hη(w˜S0;ξ˜).
Note that we have(3.37)πr-1Hη(wS0;ξ)=⋂ℓ=1mπr-1Hη(wSℓ;ξℓ), where ξℓ=ξ|wSℓ.
For each ℓ we have two possible cases: Rℓ≅Akℓ or Rℓ≇Akℓ.
Suppose first that Rℓ≅Akℓ.
For u=ur and λ=br we can apply Lemma 3.13.
Indeed, it easy to see that urbr∈P-∨ (see the proof of Proposition 3.7).
The transformation uˆ=urτ(-br)=πr-1 preserves the set Δ˜ and hence uˆR+⊂Rˆ+.
Since br is a minuscule coweight miℓ∈{-1,0,1} for i=0,1,…,kℓ (we use the notations of Lemma 3.13) and hence |ξ|ℓw+m0ℓ≤rℓ+1.
Further we have ξjℓ+mjℓ≥0 because otherwise ξjℓ=0 and mjℓ=-1; since ξ-1(0)⊂R+ the first equality means that wαjℓ∈R+, but this contradicts the second equality.
So due to Lemma 3.13 there exists an element vℓ∈Wℓ and a map ξ˜ℓ:urwvℓSℓ→Z≥0 with the sum of values not greater than rℓ such that ξ˜ℓ-1(0)⊂R+ and(3.38)πr-1Hη(wSℓ;ξℓ)=Hη(urwvℓSℓ;ξ˜ℓ).
In the case Rℓ≇Akℓ we have rℓ=0 and therefore ξℓ≡0, Hη(wSℓ;ξℓ)=H(wSℓ′).
So the relation (3.20) holds for an appropriate vℓ∈Wℓ (see the proof of Proposition 3.7).
In this case the equality (3.38) is valid for the function ξ˜ℓ:urwvℓSℓ→Z≥0 defined as ξ˜ℓ≡0.
Note that we have ξ˜ℓ-1(0)=urwvℓSℓ⊂R+.
Define the element w˜=urw∏ℓ=1mvℓ and the function ξ˜:w˜S0→Z≥0 by the formula ξ˜|w˜Sℓ=ξ˜ℓ.
We already checked in fact that |ξ˜|ℓw˜≤rℓ.
Since ξ˜ℓ-1(0)⊂R+ for all ℓ=1,…,m one has ξ˜-1(0)⊂R+.
So ξ˜∈Ξr→(w˜).
Thus we obtain πr-1Hη(wS0;ξ)=Hη(w˜S0;ξ˜) as required (cf.
(3.22)). □
Lemma 3.15
Under assumptions of Theorem 3.11 one has T0IDr→⊂IDr→.
Proof
Let f∈IDr→, w∈W and ξ∈Ξr→(w).
Then we need to prove that the function (T0f)(x) vanishes on the plane Hη(wS0;ξ).
Let ξℓ, αjℓ and ξjℓ be defined as in Lemma 3.13.
Then there are three different possibilities:(a)
θ=wθℓ and |ξ|ℓw=rℓ for some ℓ;
(b)
wαjℓ=-θ and ξjℓ=1 for some j and ℓ;
(c)
the other cases satisfying neither the condition (a) nor (b).
In the cases (a) and (b) we have α0(x)=ηθ for x∈Hη(wS0;ξ).
So that the expression (2.21) with i=0 for the function (T0f)(x) vanish on the plane Hη(wS0;ξ).
Now consider the case (c).
We will prove in this case s0Hη(wS0;ξ)⊂Dr→ by providing w˜∈W and ξ˜∈Ξr→(w˜) such that s0Hη(wS0;ξ)=Hη(w˜S0;ξ˜).
Let Rℓ≅Akℓ.
Put m0ℓ=(wθℓ,θ∨) and mjℓ=(wαjℓ,θ∨), then m0ℓ=∑j=1kℓmjℓ.
We have |miℓ|≤2 for all i=0,1,…,kℓ.
Firstly note that |ξ|ℓw+m0ℓ≤rℓ+1.
Indeed, in the case (c) we have θ≠wθℓ or |ξ|ℓw≤rℓ-1.
If the first condition holds then the inequality we are proving follows from m0ℓ≤1 and |ξ|ℓw≤rℓ, otherwise it follows from m0ℓ≤2 and |ξ|ℓw≤rℓ-1.
Secondly ξjℓ+mjℓ≥0 for all j=1,…,kℓ.
Indeed, if ξjℓ+mjℓ<0 then mjℓ<0, which implies wαjℓ∈R- and hence ξjℓ≠0; so that the only possibility is ξjℓ=1 and mjℓ=-2.
This implies wαjℓ=-θ, which is impossible in the case (c).
Note that s0=sθτ(-θ∨) satisfies s0R+⊂Rˆ+.
Thus using Lemma 3.13 for u=sθ and λ=θ∨ we have(3.39)s0Hη(wSℓ;ξℓ)=Hη(sθwvℓSℓ;ξ˜ℓ) for some element vℓ∈Wℓ and some map ξ˜ℓ:sθwvℓSℓ→Z≥0 with sum of values not greater than rℓ such that ξ˜ℓ-1(0)⊂R+.
If Rℓ≇Akℓ then rℓ=0 and, therefore, ξℓ≡0, Hη(wSℓ;ξℓ)=H(wSℓ′).
So we have the equality (3.24) for the appropriate vℓ∈Wℓ (see the proof of Lemma 3.9).
Thus in this case the relation (3.39) is valid for the map ξ˜ℓ:sθwvℓSℓ→Z≥0 defined as ξ˜ℓ≡0.
Note that we have ξ˜ℓ-1(0)=sθwvℓSℓ⊂R+.
Define the element w˜=sθw∏ℓ=1mvℓ and the function ξ˜:w˜S0→Z≥0 by the formula ξ˜|w˜Sℓ=ξ˜ℓ.
We already checked that |ξ˜|ℓw˜≤rℓ.
Since ξ˜ℓ-1(0)⊂R+ for all ℓ=1,…,m one has ξ˜(0)∈R+, so ξ˜∈Ξr→(w˜).
Then we obtain s0Hη(wS0;ξ)=Hη(w˜S0;ξ˜).
Thus f(x)=f(s0x)=0 for all x∈Hη(wS0;ξ) and we are left to prove that the denominator 1-e-α0(x) in the formula (3.25) does not vanish identically on the plane Hη(wS0;ξ).
Indeed otherwise α0+[0,2πip]=∑α∈S0γα[wα,ℏξ(wα)-ηα] for some p∈Z and γα∈Z.
Then there exists ℓ, 1≤ℓ≤m such that γα≠0 only for α∈Sℓ.
Hence 2πip=ℏ(∑α∈Sℓγαξ(wα)-1)-∑α∈Sℓγαηα and γα are all non-negative or all non-positive.
If rℓ=0 then ξ|wSℓ≡0 and hence wSℓ⊂R+.
Since θ∈wRℓ it follows that θ=wθℓ (cf.
Lemma 3.8) which is a contradiction as we are in case (c) and not in case (a).
If rℓ≠0 then Rℓ≅Akℓ, η|Rℓ=const.
The condition (3.31) implies(3.40)2πip=ℏ(∑α∈Sℓγαξ(wα)-1-rℓ+1kℓ+1∑α∈Sℓγα) with |γα|≤1.
Since ℏ∉2πiQ the expression in the brackets vanishes and due to |∑α∈Sℓγα|=∑α∈Sℓ|γα|≤kℓ we have a contradiction with the condition (3.29). □
Theorem 3.11 follows from Lemmas 3.12, 3.14 and 3.15.
Example 3.1
Let R=An, then Rℓ≅Akℓ, m-1+∑ℓ=1mkℓ≤n and ηα=η1 for all α∈R.
In this case the conditions (3.29) and (3.31) imply r1=⋯=rm and k1=⋯=km such that GCD(r1+1,k1+1)=1 and (k1+1)η1=(r1+1)ℏ.
The corresponding invariant ideals (in the representation of DAHA of type GLn+1) were constructed in [18].
Generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems
In this section we use the invariant ideals ID found in Section 3 to obtain commutative algebras of difference operators acting in the space of functions defined on the affine planes.
We work in the assumptions of Theorem 3.3, so that the ideal ID is invariant and the quotient module is defined.
The symmetrized Cherednik-Dunkl operators mλ(Y) considered in the quotient representation define a commutative algebra of difference operators.
We consider explicit examples of operators arising this way.
The operation of restriction
In Section 2 we reviewed how the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems are obtained in terms of the polynomial representation of DAHAs.
In this section we show how the generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems are obtained in terms of the representation(4.1)ρD:t→End(F/ID) on the quotient module F/ID.
Thus ρD(a)(g)=a(f)|D, where a∈t, f∈F and g=[f]=f|D is a class of the function f identified with its restriction on D.
Consider the subspace F0⊂F/ID of functions on D which have W-invariant extension in V, that is F0={[f]∈F/ID|f∈FW}.
Since D⊂WD0 the elements of F0 are determined by their values on the plane D0 and we can identify the space F0 with the space {f|D0|f∈FW} of functions on D0.
Since C[Y]WFW⊂FW the operators belonging to the algebra ρD(C[Y]W) preserve the space F0.
For any a∈C[Y]W letresρD(a)=ρD(a)|F0.
This operator as an operator on D0 is given more explicitly by the next theorem.
Before its formulation we introduce some notations.
Let V¯={x∈V|(α,x)=0,∀α∈S0}.
Denote by λ¯ the orthogonal projection of a vector λ∈V onto the subspace V¯ and by P∨¯ the set of projections of the coweights: P∨¯={λ¯|λ∈P∨}⊂V¯.
The shift operators τ(λ¯) preserve the affine plane D0 and therefore they act on functions ψ on this plane: τ(λ¯)ψ(x)=ψ(x-ℏλ¯), where x∈D0.
Let M¯ be the space of meromorphic functions on D0 which are restriction ψ|D0, ψ∈M.
Define the algebra D of difference operators on D0 by D¯=M¯#τ(P∨¯).
Note that any element a∈t in the representation (2.19) has the form(4.2)a=∑λ∈P∨∑w∈Wgλ,wτ(λ)w, where gλ,w∈M
Theorem 4.1
Let a∈C[Y]W have the form (4.2).
Then(4.3)resρD(a)=∑λ′∈P∨¯(∑w∈W∑λ∈P∨λ¯=λ′gλ,w)|D0τ(λ′).
Formula (4.3) defines the algebra homomorphism res:ρD(C[Y]W)→D¯.
Proof
Let us write v≈v′ for v,v′∈V if wv-v′∈2πiQ∨ for some w∈W.
Denote Pλx={ν∈P∨|x-ℏν≈x-ℏλ}.
Let fλx0(x)∈FW be a function which equals 1 in the points x≈x0-ℏλ and vanishes outside the small neighbourhoods of these points (such function exists if x0∉Z).
Note that for any f∈FW the function (af)(x) is smooth.
Let x0∈V\Z.
Substituting f=fλ0x0 for λ0∈P∨ and taking the limit x→x0 in the formula(4.4)(af)(x)=∑λ∈P∨∑w∈Wgλ,w(x)f(x-ℏλ) we obtain (afλ0x0)(x0)=limx→x0Gλ0x0(x), where Gλx0(x)=∑ν∈Pλx0∑w∈Wgν,w(x).
So that the functions Gλx0(x) are defined in the point x=x0 (have finite limit).
Note also that f|D0=0 implies (af)|D0=0 since aID⊂ID.
Hence if Gλx0(x0)≠0 for some x0∈D0\Z, λ∈P∨ then there exists w∈W such that w(x0-ℏλ)∈D0+2πiQ∨.
Let the W-invariant function η satisfying the conditions hηℓ=ℏ be generic.
In particular we will assume that Z⊅D0.
Let x0 be a generic point of D0\Z (that is a generic point of D0).
Then it follows from w(x0-ℏλ)∈D0+2πiQ∨ where w∈W that w0(x0-ℏλ)∈D0+2πiQ∨ for some w0∈W0.
Indeed, for generic x0∈D0 the formula w(x0-ℏλ)∈D0+2πiQ∨ implies w-1S0⊂V0 and hence wV0=V0.
Decomposing the element w∈W as w=w′w0 with w′∈W+, w0∈W0 (see Remark 3.1 and [17]) we obtain w′V0=V0.
Then by applying Proposition 3.2 we derive w′D0=D0 and hence w0(x0-ℏλ)∈D0+2πiQ∨.
One can show (for generic function η) that w0(x0-ℏλ)∈D0+2πiQ∨ implies x0-ℏλ≈x0-ℏλ¯.
Note that the right-hand side of (4.4) at x=x0 has the form (af)(x0)=∑λ∈P∨1|Pλx0|Gλx0(x0)f(x0-ℏλ).
Since each term contributes only if Gλx0(x0)≠0 we can rewrite the expression as(4.5)(af)(x0)=∑λ∈P∨1|Pλx0|Gλx0(x0)f(x0-ℏλ¯), where we used the W-invariance and 2πiQ∨-periodicity of the function f(x).
One can prove that if x0-ℏλ¯≈x0-ℏν¯ for some λ,ν∈P∨ then λ¯=ν¯.
Thus we get ν¯=λ¯ if Gλx0(x0)≠0 and ν∈Pλx0.
Hence the formula (4.5) can be rearranged to(4.6)(af)(x0)=∑λ′∈P∨¯(∑w∈W∑λ∈P∨λ¯=λ′gλ,w)(x0)f(x0-ℏλ′).
We established the equality (4.6) for generic x0∈D0 and η.
Since the left-hand side is defined for all x0∈D0 and η the equality is valid for all x0∈D0 and η.
Since (resρD(a)f|D0)(x0)=(af)(x0) for f∈FW the equality (4.3) follows.
Note that by putting f=fλ0′x0 where λ0′∈P∨¯ in (4.6) we see that each function (∑w∈W∑λ∈P∨,λ¯=λ0′gλ,w)(x0) is defined for any admissible η and generic x0∈D0.
Notice that if A∈D¯ is such that Aϕ=0 for any ϕ∈F0 then A=0.
Indeed consider the action of A=∑λ′∈P∨¯gλ′τ(λ′) where gλ′∈M¯ on ϕ=fλ0′x0|D0.
Then one yields gλ0′(x0)=0 for generic x0∈D0 and all λ0′∈P∨¯.
It follows that the linear map res:ρD(C[Y]W)→D¯ defined by the formula (4.3) is an algebra homomorphism. □
We are going to derive generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators using the operation resρD from Theorem 4.1.
First it is useful to note that restrictions to the invariant functions and restrictions to the quotient module can be interchanged.
More specifically, let D∈D be an operator of the form D=∑λ∈P∨gλτ(λ).
Define the operator(4.7)D¯=∑λ′∈P∨¯(∑λ∈P∨λ¯=λ′gλ)|D0τ(λ′)∈D¯ in the case when for any λ′∈P∨¯ the restricted function (∑λ∈P∨,λ¯=λ′gλ)|D0 is well-defined meromorphic function on D0.
Proposition 4.2
The subspace R¯=res∘ρD(C[Y]W)⊂D¯ is a commutative subalgebra in D¯.
The map ρD¯:D↦D¯ given by (4.7) is well defined on the subspace R=Res(C[Y]W)⊂D.
The algebra R¯ coincides with the image of the map ρD¯:R→D¯, thus it is spanned by the elements Mλ¯, λ∈P∨.
The following diagram of surjective linear maps is commutative:(4.8) and the map ρD¯:R→R¯ is an algebra homomorphism.
Proof
The space R¯ is a commutative algebra as an image of the homomorphism res∘ρD.
The definition of the map res:ρ(C[Y]W)→D¯ implies that res∘ρD(a)=Res(a)¯ for any a∈C[Y]W.
Due to this formula and surjectivity of the map Res:C[Y]W→R the operator D¯ is defined for any D∈R.
We also conclude that R¯ coincides with image of the map ρD¯:R→D¯ and that the diagram (4.8) commutes.
Since the operators Mλ form a basis in R their images Mλ¯ span the space R¯.
The commutativity of the diagram implies in turn that ρD¯:R→R¯ is a homomorphism: a′⋅b′¯=Res(a)⋅Res(b)¯=Res(a⋅b)¯=res∘ρD(a⋅b)=res∘ρD(a)⋅res∘ρD(b)=a′¯⋅b′¯, where a,b∈C[Y]W such that a′=Res(a) and b′=Res(b). □
We will say that the image D¯ of D∈R under ρD¯ is the restriction of the operator D onto D0.
The commutative subalgebra R¯⊂D¯ is the generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars system.
The restrictions M-br¯ and M-θ∨¯ of the Macdonald operators M-br and M-θ∨ are the generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators.
Integrability of generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems
Let n¯=dimD0=n-|S0|, where |S0| is a number of elements in the subset S0⊂Δ.
The set of indexes J={j∈Z>0|αj∉S0} has size n¯, let J={j1,…,jn¯}.
If j∈J then the corresponding fundamental coweight belongs to the subspace V¯, that is bj¯=bj, bj∈P∨¯ and τ(±bj) preserve the plane D0.
Theorem 4.3
The operators M-bj1¯,…,M-bjn¯¯ are algebraically independent elements of R¯.
Proof
By the formula (2.31) with λ=-bj we have(4.9)M-bj=g-bj(x)τ(-bj)+∑ν≺-bjgν-bj(x)τ(ν), where gν-bj∈M and g-bj(x)=∏α∈Rˆ-bjtαeα(x)-tα-1eα(x)-1.
Let j∈J.
Firstly note that ν≺-bj implies ν¯≠-bj.
Indeed, if a weight ν∈P∨ satisfies ν≺-bj then it follows the corresponding inequality between the lengths: |ν|≤|-bj|.
If ν¯=ν then ν¯=ν≠-bj.
If ν¯≠ν then one has |ν¯|<|ν| hence |ν¯|<|-bj| and therefore ν¯≠-bj.
Taking into account that bj¯=bj one yields(4.10)M-bj¯=g-bj|D0τ(-bj)+∑ν′∈P∨¯ν′≠-bj(∑ν≺-bjν¯=ν′gν-bj)|D0τ(ν′).
Let us prove that the function g-bj|D0 does not vanish identically.
Indeed, otherwise there exists an affine root α=[α(1),α(0)]∈Rˆ-bj such that eα(x)≡e(α(1),x)+α(0)=tα-2 for all x∈D0.
This implies that α(1)∈R is a linear combination of the elements of S0 and, consequently, (α(1),bj)=0.
But on the other handRˆ-bj=(τ(-bj)Rˆ+)∩Rˆ-={[β,ℏk]|β∈R-,k∈Z,(β,bj)<k≤0}, which implies (α(1),bj)<0.
Hence g-bj|D0≢0.
Let us introduce the order on the set P∨¯: we will write ν′⋗λ′ for ν′,λ′∈P∨¯ if ν′≠λ′ and ν′-λ′=∑i=1nγiαi∨¯ for some γi∈Z≥0.
One can check that this is a partial order on P∨¯.
The ordering ν≺-bj for ν∈P∨ implies ν>-bj, ν¯≠-bj and hence ν¯⋗-bj.
So denoting g¯ν′-bj=∑ν≺-bj,ν¯=ν′gν-bj∈M¯ for ν′≠-bj we obtain(4.11)M-bj¯=g-bj|D0τ(-bj)+∑ν′∈P∨¯ν′⋗-bjg¯ν′-bjτ(ν′), where g-bj|D0≠0.
Let m1,…,mn¯∈Z≥0 and λ′=-∑l=1n¯mlbjl∈P-∨¯, then(4.12)∏l=1n¯(M-bjl¯)ml=gm1,…,mn¯τ(λ′)+∑ν′∈P∨¯ν′⋗λ′gν′m1,…,mn¯τ(ν′), where gm1,…,mn¯,gν′m1,…,mn¯∈M¯ and gm1,…,mn¯≠0.
Since the operators (4.12) are linearly independent the elements M-bj1¯,…,M-bjn¯¯ are algebraically independent. □
Now we introduce some notations.
Let f be a function of several variables depending, in particular, on a complex variable z.
Then we denote by Tza the operator acting on f by the shift:(4.13)(Tzaf)(…,z,…)=f(…,z+a,…), where a∈C.
Let xi=(ei,x)+ci for i=1,…,N, where {ei} is a set of pairwise orthogonal vectors in CN and ci∈C.
Then we have TxiℏKi=τ(-ei) on the functions f(x)=f(x1,…,xN), where Ki=(ei,ei).
An type examples
The root system R=An is defined as {ei-ej|i,j=1,…,n+1,i≠j} considered in the space V={x=∑i=1n+1xiei∈Cn+1|∑i=1n+1xi=0}, where {ei} is the standard orthonormal basis in Cn+1.
The simple roots are α1=e1-e2, α2=e2-e3,…,αn=en-en+1 and the maximal root is θ=e1-en+1 All fundamental coweights br, r=1,…,n are minuscule.
Any Wˆ-invariant function t:Rˆ→C\{0} is constant.
We will consider functions f on V as functions of n+1 variables satisfying the condition ∏i=1n+1Txiaf(x1,…,xn+1)=f(x1,…,xn+1), ∀a∈C.
Then we have Txiℏf=τ(-ei)f=τ(-eˆi)f, where eˆi is the orthogonal projection of the vector ei to the subspace V⊂Cn+1.
Taking the coweight b1=eˆ1 in (2.25) we obtain the operator(4.14)M-b1=∑i=1n+1∏j=1j≠in+1texj-xi-t-1exj-xi-1Txiℏ.
Any root subsystem R0 has irreducible components Rℓ of type A only in its decomposition R0=⨆ℓ=1mRℓ.
The invariant function η=const.
The generalized Coxeter number is hηℓ=kη for Rℓ≅Ak-1.
Thus the conditions (3.13) lead to R1≅R2≅⋯≅Rm≅Ak-1 and ℏ=kη for some k∈Z≥2.
Let us choose(4.15)Sℓ={eN1+k(ℓ-1)+1-eN1+k(ℓ-1)+2,…,eN1+kℓ-1-eN1+kℓ},ℓ=1,…,N2, where N1=n+1-mk and N2=m.
Introduce new variables(4.16)yℓ=1k∑s=0k-1(xN1+kℓ-s-sη)=1k∑s=0k-1xN1+kℓ-s-k-12η,ℓ=1,…,N2.
Note that xN1+kℓ-s|D0=yℓ|D0+sη for all s=0,…,k-1.
The values of the variables xi,yℓ with i=1,…,N1, ℓ=1,…,N2 satisfying ∑i=1N1xi+k∑ℓ=1N2yℓ=-k(k-1)η/2 uniquely determine a point on the affine plane D0.
The functions f:D0→C are functions f(x1,…,xN1,y1,…,yN2) satisfying ∏i=1N1Txia∏ℓ=1N2Tyℓa/kf=f, ∀a∈C.
Proposition 4.4
Let t=eη/2.
The restriction of the operator (4.14) onto D0 takes the form(4.17)M-b1¯=∑i=1N1∏j=1j≠iN1texj-xi-t-1exj-xi-1∏ℓ′=1N2qeyℓ′-xi-q-1eyℓ′-xi-1Txiℏ+q-q-1t-t-1∑ℓ=1N2∏j=1N1texj-yℓ-t-1exj-yℓ-1∏ℓ′=1ℓ′≠ℓN2qeyℓ′-yℓ-q-1eyℓ′-yℓ-1Tyℓη.
Proof
The coefficient at Txiℏ in M-b1 has non-zero restriction on D0 only if 1≤i≤N1 or i=N1+kℓ for some ℓ=1,…,N2.
These restrictions can be calculated explicitly using the formulae (valid on D0)∏s=0k-1g(xN1+kℓ′-s-a;t,1)=g(yℓ′-a;tk,1),∏s=1k-1g(xN1+kℓ-s-xN1+kℓ;t,1)=g(0;tk,t)=tk-t-kt-t-1, where a∈C and g(z;b,c)=bez-b-1cez-c-1.
Further since ei¯=ei for i=1,…,N1 the restriction of Txiℏ=τ(-ei) in this case coincides with Txiℏ.
For i=N1+kℓ the restriction of Txiℏ=τ(-ei) is equal to Tyℓℏ/k due to ei¯=1k∑s=0k-1eN1+kℓ-s and yℓ=(ei¯,x)-(k-1)η/2 (see the end of Section 4.2).
Taking into account the condition ℏ=kη and its exponential form q=tk we can write the restriction of (4.14) in the form (4.17). □
Note that the operator (4.17) does not effectively depend on k, it depends on N1, N2, ℏ, η only, where it is assumed that ℏ/η∈Z>0.
The operator (4.17) was previously obtained and investigated in [29] for general parameters ℏ and η and earlier in [2] in the case N2=1.
The formula (2.25) gives the explicit form of n Macdonald operators(4.18)M-br=∑I⊂{1,…,n+1}|I|=r∏i∈Ij∉Itexj-xi-t-1exj-xi-1∏i∈ITxiℏ,r=1,…,n, where |I| is the number of elements in the set I⊂{1,…,n+1}.
Similar to the proof of Proposition 4.4 we calculate the restrictions of the operators (4.18) onto D0.
We obtain(4.19)M-br¯=∑I⊂{1,…,N1}mℓ∈Z≥0|I|+∑ℓ=1N2mℓ=r∏i,j=1i∈Ij∉IN1texj-xi-t-1exj-xi-1∏ℓ,ℓ′=1N2∏s=0mℓ-1qt-seyℓ′-yℓ-q-1tstmℓ′-seyℓ′-yℓ-ts-mℓ′∏ℓ=1i∈IN2qeyℓ-xi-q-1tmℓeyℓ-xi-t-mℓ∏ℓ=1j∉IN2texj-yℓ-t-1t1-mℓexj-yℓ-tmℓ-1∏i∈ITxiℏ∏ℓ=1N2Tyℓmℓη, where q=eℏ/2, t=eη/2.
In the case r=1 the operator (4.19) takes the form (4.17).
Theorem 4.5
For any values of the parameters ℏ and η the operators M-br¯ given by the formula (4.19), r∈Z>0, pairwise commute.
The operators M-br¯ with r=1,…,N1+N2-1 are algebraically independent at generic values of ℏ and η.
Proof
For any r,r′∈Z>0 the commutator has the form(4.20)[M-br¯,M-br′¯]=∑k1,…,kN1∈Z≥0m1,…,mN2∈Z≥0Cm1,…,mN2k1,…,kN1(x,y;q,t)∏i=1N1Txikiℏ∏ℓ=1N2Tyℓmℓη, where the coefficients Cm1,…,mN2k1,…,kN1(x,y;q,t) are rational functions of q=eℏ/2 and t=eη/2.
It follows from Proposition 4.2 that these functions equal zero if ℏ,η∈C\πiQ such that ℏ/η∈Z>1 and N1+ℏηN2>max(r,r′).
Thus the coefficients vanish for any parameters ℏ and η, and the operators commute.
The second part follows from the fact that the operators M-br¯ at ℏ=η are specializations of the Macdonald operators M-br with n=N1+N2-1, which are algebraically independent. □
Bn type examples
The root system R=Bn is defined as the set {ϵei+ϵ′ej|1≤i<j≤n,ϵ,ϵ′=±1}∪{ϵei|1≤i≤n,ϵ=±1}.
The simple roots are α1=e1-e2, α2=e2-e3,…,αn-1=en-1-en, αn=en.
The maximal root is θ=e1+e2.
The group Wˆ has two orbits on Rˆ so the function t:Rˆ→C\{0} is determined by the values t1=t±ei±ej and tn=t±ei.
There is a unique minuscule coweight b1=e1.
The corresponding Macdonald operator is(4.21)M-e1=∑i=1n(∏j=1j≠in(t1exi-xj-t1-1)(t1exi+xj-t1-1)(exi-xj-1)(exi+xj-1)tnexi-tn-1exi-1Txi-ℏ+∏j=1j≠in(t1exj-xi-t1-1)(t1e-xi-xj-t1-1)(exj-xi-1)(e-xi-xj-1)tne-xi-tn-1e-xi-1Txiℏ), where xi=(ei,x) are coordinates on V.
The invariant function η satisfies η1=η2=⋯=ηn-1 and ηθ=η1.
The generalized Coxeter number is hηℓ=kη1 for Rℓ≅Ak-1 and hηℓ=2(k-1)η1+2ηn if Rℓ≅Bk.
We have two cases αn∉S0 and αn∈S0 depending on the choice of S0⊂Δ.
Consider first the case αn∉S0.
All the irreducible components Rℓ are of type A.
Then the conditions hηℓ=ℏ imply ℏ=kη1 for some k∈Z>0 and Rℓ≅Ak-1 for all ℓ.
Hence q=t1k and we can choose(4.22)Sℓ={eN1+k(ℓ-1)+1-eN1+k(ℓ-1)+2,…,eN1+kℓ-1-eN1+kℓ},ℓ=1,…,N2, where N1=n-mk and N2=m.
Define new variables(4.23)yℓ=1k∑s=0k-1xN1+kℓ-s=k-12η1+1k∑s=0k-1(xN1+kℓ-s-sη1),ℓ=1,…,N2.
Note that xN1+kℓ-s|D0=yℓ|D0-(k-1)η1/2+sη1 for all s=0,…,k-1.
The variables xi,yℓ with i=1,…,N1, ℓ=1,…,N2 form a system of orthogonal coordinates on the affine plane D0.
Proposition 4.6
Let t1=eη1/2.
In the case αn∉S0 the restriction of the operator (4.21) onto D0 takes the form(4.24)M-e1¯=∑i=1ϵ=±1N1Aiϵ(x,y)Txi-ϵℏ+q-q-1t1-t1-1∑ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2Bℓϵ(x,y)Tyℓ-ϵη1, where(4.25)Aiϵ(x,y)=∏j=1j≠iN1(g(ϵxi-xj;t1,1)g(ϵxi+xj;t1,1))∏ℓ′=1N2(g(ϵxi-yℓ′;q1/2t11/2,q-1/2t11/2)g(ϵxi+yℓ′;q1/2t11/2,q-1/2t11/2))g(ϵxi;tn,1),(4.26)Bℓϵ(x,y)=∏j=1N1(g(ϵyℓ-xj;q1/2t11/2,q1/2t1-1/2)g(ϵyℓ+xj;q1/2t11/2,q1/2t1-1/2))∏ℓ′=1ℓ′≠ℓN2(g(ϵyℓ-yℓ′;q,1)g(ϵyℓ+yℓ′;q,1))g(ϵyℓ;q1/2t1-1/2tn,q1/2t1-1/2)g(2ϵyℓ;qt1-1,1), and(4.27)g(z;a,b)=aez-a-1bez-b-1,a,b∈C.
Proof
The coefficient at Txi-ϵℏ in M-e1 has non-zero restriction on D0 only if 1≤i≤N1 or i=N1+kℓ-(1+ϵ)(k-1)/2 for some ℓ=1,…,N2.
To calculate these coefficients we first use(4.28)∏s=0k-1g(a±xN1+kℓ′-s;t1,1)=g(a±yℓ′;q1/2t11/2,q-1/2t11/2),(4.29)∏s=0s≠N1+kℓ-ik-1g(ϵxi-xN1+kℓ-s;t1,1)g(ϵxi+xN1+kℓ-s;t1,1)=g(0;q,t)g(2ϵyℓ;qt1-1,1), where i=N1+kℓ-(1+ϵ)(k-1)/2.
Further, if i=N1+kℓ-(1+ϵ)(k-1)/2 then we have ϵxi=ϵ(yℓ-(k-1)η1/2+(1+ϵ)(k-1)η1/2)=ϵyℓ+(k-1)η1/2 and hence(4.30)g(ϵxi+a;b,c)=g(ϵyℓ+a;bq1/2t1-1/2,cq1/2t1-1/2) for any b,c≠0.
Thus we obtain (4.24). □
If αn∈S0 then we suppose that the numeration of the components Sℓ is such that αn∈Sm.
Then Rℓ≅Ak-1 for ℓ=1,…,m-1 and Rm≅Bk˜, where k=|S1|+1 and k˜=|Sm|.
Put N1=n-(m-1)k-k˜, N2=m-1, and let S1,…,Sm-1 have the form (4.22), while(4.31)Sm={en-k˜+1-en-k˜+2,en-k˜+2-en-k˜+3,…,en-1-en,en}.
The variables x1,…,xN1 together with (4.23) are coordinates on D0.
Proposition 4.7
Let t1=eη1/2 and tn=eηn/2.
In the case αn∈S0 the restriction of the operator (4.21) onto D0 takes the form(4.32)M-e1¯=∑i=1ϵ=±1N1A˜iϵ(x,y)Txi-ϵℏ+q-q-1t1-t1-1∑ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2B˜ℓϵ(x,y)Tyℓ-ϵη1+C˜(x,y), where(4.33)A˜iϵ(x,y)=g(ϵxi;t1tn-1,q-1/2)g(ϵxi;q1/2t1,1)∏j=1j≠iN1g(ϵxi-xj;t1,1)g(ϵxi+xj;t1,1)∏ℓ′=1N2g(ϵxi-yℓ′;q1/2t11/2,q-1/2t11/2)g(ϵxi+yℓ′;q1/2t11/2,q-1/2t11/2),(4.34)B˜ℓϵ(x,y)=g(ϵyℓ;q1/2t11/2tn-1,t1-1/2)g(ϵyℓ;qt11/2,q1/2t1-1/2)g(2ϵyℓ;qt1-1,1)∏j=1N1g(ϵyℓ-xj;q1/2t11/2,q1/2t1-1/2)g(ϵyℓ+xj;q1/2t11/2,q1/2t1-1/2)∏ℓ′=1ℓ′≠ℓN2g(ϵyℓ-yℓ′;q,1)g(ϵyℓ+yℓ′;q,1),(4.35)C˜(x,y)=(q1/2t1tn-1-q-1/2t1-1tn)(q1/2+q-1/2)t1-t1-1∏j=1N1g(-xj;q1/2t1,q1/2)g(xj;q1/2t1,q1/2)∏ℓ′=1N2g(-yℓ′;qt11/2,t11/2)g(yℓ′;qt11/2,t11/2), and g(z;a,b) is defined by (4.27).
Proof
Note that xn-s=ηn+sη1 for all s=0,…,k˜-1.
So the functional coefficient at Txi-ϵℏ has non-zero restriction on D0 only if 1≤i≤N1 or i=N1+kℓ-(1+ϵ)(k-1)/2 for some ℓ=1,…,N2 or i-n+k˜=ϵ=+1.
To calculate the coefficients for the first two cases we use the formulae (4.28), (4.29), (4.30) and the formulag(a;tn,1)∏s=0k˜-1g(a-xn-s;t1,1)g(a+xn-s;t1,1)=g(a;t1tn-1;q1/2)g(a;q1/2t1,1).
The restriction of Txn-k˜+1-ℏ yields the identity operator 1.
The corresponding coefficient is calculated usingg(xn-k˜+1+a;b,c)=g(a;bt1k˜-1tn,ct1k˜-1tn)=g(a;bq1/2,cq1/2),g(xi;tn,1)∏s=0k˜-2g(xi-xn-s;t1,1)g(xi+xn-s;t1,1)=g(0;q1/2t1tn-1,t1)g(0;q,q1/2), where i=n-k˜+1 and we used the condition 2(k˜-1)η1+2ηn=ℏ in the form t1k˜-1tn=±q1/2. □
Remark 4.1
The operator (4.32) can be rewritten in the form(4.36)M-e1¯=∑i=1ϵ=±1N1A˜iϵ(x,y)(Txi-ϵℏ-1)+q-q-1t1-t1-1∑ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2B˜ℓϵ(x,y)(Tyℓ-ϵη1-1)+m-e1,t, where m-e1,t=t1n-t1-nt1-t1-1(tnt1n-1+tn-1t11-n).
Remark 4.2
Rational degeneration of the operators (4.24) and (4.32) can be obtained by substitution xi→xi/ω, yi→yi/ω, ηα→ηα/ω, ℏ→ℏ/ω and taking the limit ω→∞.
This gives particular case of the operator considered by Sergeev and Veselov in [30, formula (94)], see also [12].
An example from root system F4
The root system R=F4 is given in V=C4 by(4.37)R={ϵei|1≤i≤4,ϵ=±1}∪{ϵ1ei+ϵ2ej|1≤i<j≤4,ϵ1,ϵ2=±1}∪{12∑k=14νkek|ν1,…,ν4=±1}.
The simple roots are α1=e2-e3, α2=e3-e4, α3=e4 and α4=12(e1-e2-e3-e4).
The maximal root is θ=e1+e2.
The corresponding Weyl group W has two orbits on R.
There are no minuscule coweights in this case.
The W-invariant function η satisfies η1=η2 and η3=η4.
We impose t0=t1=t2=eη1/2 and t3=t4=eη3/2.
The Macdonald operator (2.27) takes the form(4.38)M-θ∨=∑1≤i<j≤4ϵ1,ϵ2=±1g(ϵ1xi;t3,1)g(ϵ2xj;t3,1)∏k≠i,jϵ3=±1(g(ϵ1xi+ϵ3xk;t1,1)g(ϵ2xj+ϵ3xk;t1,1))∏ν1,…,ν4=±1νi=ϵ1,νj=ϵ2g(12∑k=14νkxk;t3,1)g(ϵ1xi+ϵ2xj;t1,1)g(ϵ1xi+ϵ2xj;q-1t1,q-1)(Txi-ϵ1ℏTxj-ϵ2ℏ-1)+m-θ∨,t, where g(z;a,b) is defined by (4.27).
Let us consider the simplest example S0={α3}≅A1.
Then D0={x∈V|x4=η3} and the condition (3.13) becomes 2η3=ℏ.
The restriction of the operator (4.38) takes the form(4.39)M-θ∨¯=∑1≤i<j≤3ϵ1,ϵ2=±1g(ϵ1xi;q1/2,1)g(ϵ1xi;t1q1/2,q1/2)g(ϵ1xi;t1q-1/2,q-1/2)g(ϵ2xj;q1/2,1)g(ϵ2xj;t1q1/2,q1/2)g(ϵ2xj;t1q-1/2,q-1/2)g(ϵ1xi+ϵ2xj;t1,1)g(ϵ1xi+ϵ2xj;q-1t1,q-1)∏ϵ3=±1(g(ϵ1xi+ϵ3xk;t1,1)g(ϵ2xj+ϵ3xk;t1,1)g(12(ϵ1xi+ϵ2xj+ϵ3xk);q3/4,q-1/4))(Txi-ϵ1ℏTxj-ϵ2ℏ-1)+(q1/2+q-1/2)∑1≤i≤3ϵ1=±1g(ϵ1xi;q1/2,1)∏l≠i,4ϵ3=±1(g(ϵ1xi+ϵ3xl;t1,1)g(ϵ3xl;q1/2t1,q1/2))∏ν1,…,ν3=±1νi=ϵ1g(12∑l=13νlxl;q3/4,q1/4)g(ϵ1xi;t1q1/2,q1/2)g(ϵ1xi;q-1/2t1,q-1/2)(Txi-ϵ1ℏ-1)+m-θ∨,t, where in every term in the sum k is such that 1≤k≤3, k≠i,j; and t1=eη1/2, q1/2=eℏ/4 are parameters.
Remark 4.3
It is possible to obtain a commuting operator to (4.39) by restriction of the relevant Macdonald operators for the small weights [32].
Similarly one can get Hamiltonians and quantum integrals starting from the Macdonald operators for the small weights in the case of other exceptional root systems.
The case (Cn∨,Cn)
The affine root system of type (Cn∨,Cn) is given by(5.1)S={[ϵ1ei+ϵ2ej,ℏk]|1≤i<j≤n;ϵ1,ϵ2=±1;k∈Z}∪{ϵ⋅[ei,ℏk2]|1≤i≤n;ϵ=±1,±2;k∈Z}⊂Vˆ (see [23,25]).
Let W˜ be the group generated by the affine reflections sα with α∈S.
The corresponding DAHA is defined in [28] (see also [26]).
We recall the associated commuting difference operators below.
Let R=Cn, that is(5.2)R={ϵ1ei+ϵ2ej|1≤i<j≤n;ϵ1,ϵ2=±1}∪{ϵ2ei|1≤i≤n;ϵ=±1},(5.3)Δ={αi=ei-ei+1|i=1,…,n-1}∪{αn=2en}⊂R, let Rˆ={[α,ℏk]|α∈R;k∈Z} and Δ˜=Δ∪{α0=[-θ,ℏ]=[-2e1,ℏ]}.
Then W˜={sα|α∈S}={sα|α∈Rˆ} is the affine Weyl group for Cn.
Let Q∨, P∨, P and W be the lattices of coroots, of coweights, of weights and the Weyl group for the root system R=Cn respectively.
Let also Pˆ⊂Vˆ be the subset defined in Section 2.1 for R=Cn.
Noumi representation of (Cn∨,Cn) type DAHA and Koornwinder operator
Let t,u:Rˆ→C\{0} be such that tα=tw˜α=t(α), uα=uw˜α=u(α) for any w˜∈W˜, α∈Rˆ.
Put u±ei±ej=1, ti=tαi, ui=uαi.
So we have t1=t2=⋯=tn-1 and u1=u2=⋯=un-1=1.
Definition 5.1
(See [28].) Double Affine Hecke Algebra of type (Cn∨,Cn) is the algebra t,u generated by the elements T0,T1,…,Tn, and by the set of pairwise commuting elements {Xμ}μ∈Pˆ with the relations (2.4)-(2.7), (2.10) and(5.4)Ti-1XμTi-1=Xμ-αi+(ui-ui-1)Xμ-αi/2Ti-1,if (μ,αi∨)=1,μ∈Pˆ, where i=0,1,…,n.
The algebra t,u depends on six independent parameters t1, tn, t0, un, u0 and ℏ.
Note that the elements πr are not included in this case.
One can also define an 'extended' version of (Cn∨,Cn) type DAHA where affine Weyl group W˜=W⋉τ(Q∨) is replaced with the extended affine Weyl group Wˆ=W⋉τ(P∨).
However the Wˆ-invariance of the functions t,u leads to less independent parameters in this algebra and subsequently in the commuting difference operators.
Note also that if u0=un=1 then the algebra t,u can be interpreted as a 'non-extended' version of DAHA of type Cnˆ.
Consider the action of the generators of t,u on the space F given by the Noumi representation [26](5.5)Xμ=eμ(x),Ti=ti+ti-1(1-tiuie-αi(x)/2)(1+tiui-1e-αi(x)/2)1-e-αi(x)(si-1), where μ∈Pˆ, i=0,1,…,n.
The elements Tw˜∈t,u with w˜∈W˜ and Cherednik-Dunkl operators Yλ∈t,u with λ∈Q∨ are defined by the formula (2.12), where πr=1, and(5.6)Yλ-ν=Tτ(λ)Tτ(ν)-1,λ,ν∈P+∨∩Q∨.
The operators Yλ commute with each other and satisfy the relations [26,25](5.7)TiYλ-YsiλTi=ti-ti-1+(t¯i-t¯i-1)Y-αi∨1-Y-2αi∨(Yλ-Ysiλ),i=1,…,n, where λ∈Q∨, t¯i=ti for i=1,…,n-1 and t¯n=t0.
Let C[Y] be the commutative subalgebra of t,u spanned by the Cherednik-Dunkl operators (5.6).
The relation (5.7) implies that the elements of the subalgebra C[Y]W⊂C[Y] preserve the subspace of W-invariant functions F, that is mλ(Y)FW⊂FW, where λ∈Q∨ and mλ(Y) is the operator defined by the formula (2.22).
By restricting these operators to the subspace FW we obtain the difference operators Mλ given by formula (2.24) with (2.23).
Thus we get a commutative algebra R spanned by Mλ with λ∈Q∨.
It is generated by the algebraically independent elements Mνi=M-νi, where νi=e1+e2+⋯+ei and i=1,…,n.
The first of the generators is the Koornwinder operator [26,21](5.8)M-e1=M-θ∨=∑i=1ϵ=±1n(t0tn)-1∏j=1j≠in(g(ϵxi-xj;t1,1)g(ϵxi+xj;t1,1))(1-t0u0q-1eϵxi)(1+t0u0-1q-1eϵxi)(1-tnuneϵxi)(1+tnun-1eϵxi)(1-q-2e2ϵxi)(1-e2ϵxi)(Txi-ϵℏ-1)+κt, where g(z;a,b)=aez-a-1bez-b-1 and κt=t1n-t1-nt1-t1-1(t0tnt1n-1+t0-1tn-1t11-n).
Invariant ideals and generalized Koornwinder operator
Let η:R→C be a W-invariant function.
It is defined by independent parameters η1=ηα1 and ηn=ηαn.
Let S0⊂Δ and let D0, W+, D and ID be defined in the same way as in Section 3 for the case R=Cn.
Let S0=⨆ℓ=1mSℓ and R0=⨆ℓ=1mRℓ be the decompositions defined in Section 3.2.
We denote kℓ=|Sℓ|.
There are two possible cases: αn∉S0 and αn∈S0.
In the former case the components Rℓ≅Akℓ for all ℓ=1,…,m.
In the latter case one of the components is of type C.
We suppose αn∈Sm so that Rℓ≅Akℓ for all ℓ=1,…,m-1 and Rm≅Ckm.
Lemma 5.1
Assume that(5.9)hηℓ=ℏ,whenever αn∉Rℓ.
Let w∈W+ be such that wθℓ≠θ for all ℓ=1,…,m.
Then s0Hη(wS0)⊂D.
Proof
If αn∉S0 then the assumptions of Lemma 3.9 hold and, therefore, s0Hη(wS0)⊂D.
If αn∈S0 then the statement can be proved in the same way as Lemma 3.9.
Indeed, in the proof of Lemma 3.9 the condition hηℓ=ℏ was used only if (wθℓ,θ∨)=1.
Thus it is sufficient to establish that (wθm,θ∨)=0.
Since wSm consists of positive roots only this set has the form(5.10)wSm={ei1-ei2,ei2-ei3,…,eikm-1-eikm,2eikm}, for some 1≤i1<i2<⋯<ikm≤n.
Since wθm=2ei1 the condition wθm≠θ=2e1 implies i1≠1 and, hence, (wθm,θ∨)=(2ei1,e1)=0. □
Theorem 5.2
Suppose the subset S0⊂Δ and the function η are such that the condition (5.9) is satisfied.
Suppose the parameters of DAHA t,u are such that t12=eη1 if n>1 and ϵntnunϵn=eηn/2 for some ϵn=±1.
Suppose also that if αn∈S0 then(5.11)ϵ0ϵntnt0unϵnu0ϵ0t12(k˜-1)q-1=1 for some ϵ0=±1, where k˜=|Sm| is the rank of the irreducible component of type C.
Then the ideal ID⊂F is invariant under the action of t,u in the Noumi representation (5.5).
Proof
Let f∈ID and x∈wD0 for some w∈W+.
The operators T1,…,Tn-1 have the same form as the operators T1,…,Tn-1 of Section 3 in the case R=Cn, and the proof of invariance under their action follows by Proposition 3.5.
To prove the invariance under Tn note that if αn∉wS0 then we have f(x)=f(snx)=0 and, hence, Tnf(x)=0 (see the proof of Proposition 3.5).
If αn∈wS0 then 1-tnune-xn=0 or 1+tnun-1e-xn=0 hence Tnf(x)=0.
To prove the invariance under T0 suppose first that wθℓ=θ for some ℓ.
This is possible only if αn∈S0 and ℓ=m since αn∈Sm.
In this case we obtain -α0(x)=(wθm,x)-ℏ=hηm-ηθ-ℏ=2(k˜-1)η1+ηn-ℏ.
Then the condition (5.11) implies that ϵ0t0u0ϵ0e-α0(x)/2=1 for some ϵ0=±1.
Now T0f(x)=0 since t0u0e-α0(x)/2=1 or t0u0-1e-α0(x)/2=-1.
In the case when wθℓ≠θ for all ℓ=1,…,m the plane s0(wD0)=s0Hη(wS0) is contained in D due to Lemma 5.1 and hence f(s0x)=0.
As in the proof of Proposition 3.10 it follows that T0f(x)=0 for all x∈wD0. □
Remark 5.1
The condition (5.11) can be rewritten in the form ϵ0t0u0ϵ0=eη0/2 where η0∈C is such that 2(k˜-1)η1+ηn+η0=ℏ.
Thus the number hˆηm=2(k˜-1)η1+ηn+η0 can be interpreted as a generalized Coxeter number for the affine root system Rˆm⊂S of type (Ck˜∨,Ck˜).
Remark 5.2
Submodules in the polynomial representation of DAHA of type (Cn∨,Cn) were investigated by Kasatani [19].
In the case αn∉S0 the invariant ideals ID correspond to the Kasataniʼs submodules Im(k,r) with r=2 (see [19, Proposition 4.13]).
In the case αn∈S0, m=1 the ideals ID correspond to the submodules V with r=2 constructed in the paper [19, Section 4.8], the conditions (5.11) correspond to the conditions (49), (50) of [19] with r=2.
Theorem 5.2 guarantees that the arguments of Section 4.1 remain valid in the (Cn∨,Cn) case.
Thus we obtain the commutative algebra R¯ spanned by the operators Mλ¯, λ∈Q∨, defined by the formula (4.7).
To establish the integrability we use the method of Section 4.2 where the lattice P∨ is replaced by Q∨.
Note that νi=e1+e2+⋯+ei, i=1,…,n, form the basis of Q∨.
As before we denote J={j=1,…,n|αj∉S0}={j1,…,jn¯}, where n¯=dimD0.
Theorem 5.3
The algebra R¯ contains n¯ algebraically independent elements, namely, the operators M-νj1¯,…,M-νjn¯¯.
Indeed, the operators Mλ in this case have the form (2.31) withgλ(x)=∏α∈Rˆλ(1-tαuαeα(x)/2)(1+tαuα-1eα(x)/2)1-eα(x).
If the function g-νj(x) is identically zero on D0 for some j∈J then the function 1-tαuαeα(x)/2 or 1+tαuα-1eα(x)/2 is identically zero on D0 for some α=[α(1),α(0)]∈Rˆ-νj.
It is possible only if α is a linear combination of the elements of S0 and hence (α(1),νj)=0.
From the definition of Rˆλ it follows that (α(1),νj)<0, hence g-νj|D0≢0, and the operators M-νj, j∈J, are algebraically independent (see the proof of Theorem 4.3 for details).
The algebra R¯ contains the generalized Koornwinder operator.
Let us introduce this operator explicitly.
It acts on functions of two sets of variables x1,…,xN1, y1,…,yN2 and it depends on six independent parameters: two shift parameters ℏ, ξ and the parameters a,b,c,d.
It is defined as(5.12)MN1,N2=∑i=1ϵ=±1N1Aiϵ(x,y)(Txi-ϵℏ-1)+1-q-21-s-2∑ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2Bℓϵ(x,y)(Tyℓ-ϵξ-1), where q=eℏ/2, s=eξ/2 and(5.13)Aiϵ(x,y)=∏j=1j≠iN1g(ϵxi-xj;s,1)g(ϵxi+xj;s,1)∏ℓ′=1N2g(ϵxi-yℓ′;q1/2s1/2,q-1/2s1/2)g(ϵxi+yℓ′;q1/2s1/2,q-1/2s1/2)(1-aeϵxi)(1-beϵxi)(1-ceϵxi)(1-deϵxi)(1-q-2e2ϵxi)(1-e2ϵxi),(5.14)Bℓϵ(x,y)=∏j=1N1g(ϵyℓ-xj;q1/2s1/2,q1/2s-1/2)g(ϵyℓ+xj;q1/2s1/2,q1/2s-1/2)∏ℓ′=1ℓ′≠ℓN2g(ϵyℓ-yℓ′;q,1)g(ϵyℓ+yℓ′;q,1)(1-aqs-1eϵyℓ)(1-bqs-1eϵyℓ)(1-cqs-1eϵyℓ)(1-dqs-1eϵyℓ)(1-s-2e2ϵyℓ)(1-e2ϵyℓ).
For N2=0 this operator coincides with the Koornwinder operator (5.8) up to a constant and a factor (where a,b,c,d,ξ are expressed through the parameters of DAHA t,u).
We note that this operator is invariant (up to a factor) under the involution(5.15)N1↔N2,x↔y,ξ↔ℏ,s↔q,a↦aqs-1,b↦bqs-1,c↦cqs-1,d↦dqs-1.
Now we explain how this operator arises by the restriction of the Koornwinder operator M-e1.
Consider first the case αn∉S0.
In this case we assume that all the subsets Sℓ coincide with (4.22) and t1=eη1/2.
Then N1=n-mk, N2=m, ℏ=kη1, q=t1k.
We introduce orthogonal coordinates x1,…,xN1, y1,…,yN2 on the corresponding plane D0 by (4.23).
Proposition 5.4
In the case αn∉S0 we have M-e1¯=(t0tn)-1MN1,N2+κt, where MN1,N2 is the generalized Koornwinder operator (5.12) with N1=n-mk, N2=m and the parameterss=t1,ξ=η1,a=t0u0q-1,b=-t0u0-1q-1,c=tnun,d=-tnun-1 satisfying the condition ℏ/η1=k∈Z≥2.
In the case αn∈S0 the subsets Sℓ with ℓ=1,…,m-1 coincide with (4.22) and(5.16)Sm={en-k˜+1-en-k˜+2,en-k˜+2-en-k˜+3,…,en-1-en,2en}, where k˜=km=|Sm|; t1=eη1/2, ϵntnunϵn=eηn/2.
Then(5.17)N1=n-(m-1)k-k˜,N2=m-1, and the orthogonal coordinates x1,…,xN1, y1,…,yN2 on D0 are given by (4.23).
Proposition 5.5
In the case αn∈S0 we have M-e1¯=(t0tnt12k˜)-1MN1,N2+κt, where MN1,N2 is the generalized Koornwinder operator (5.12) with N1, N2 given by (5.17) and the parameterss=t1,ξ=η1,a=ϵnt12tn-1un-ϵn,b=-ϵntnun-ϵn,c=ϵ0qt12t0-1u0-ϵ0,d=-q-1ϵ0t0u0-ϵ0 where the condition (5.11) holds for k˜∈Z≥1, and if m>1 then ℏ/η1=k∈Z≥2.
The propositions can be established by direct calculations.
In both cases the obtained operators M-e1¯ depend on six independent parameters.
Namely, in the case αn∉S0 we have five continuous parameters ξ,a,b,c,d and one discrete parameter k (where ℏ=kξ), and in the case αn∈S0 we have four continuous parameters ξ,b,c,d and two discrete ones k,k˜ (ℏ=kξ, a=c-1e(k˜+1)ξ).
Remark 5.3
The operator (5.12) generalizes the deformed rational Koornwinder operator [30, formula (94)].
Namely the latter can be obtained by the substitution xi→xi/ω, yi→yi/ω, ξ→ξ/ω, ℏ→ℏ/ω, a=ea′/ω, b=-eb′/ω, c=ec′/ω, d=-ed′/ω to (5.12) and by taking the limit ω→∞.
It follows from above that the operator MN1,N2 comes together with the complete algebra of commuting difference operators.
We specify these operators explicitly and establish commutativity (without extra integrality restriction for a combination of parameters).
We start with the explicit formula for the higher Koornwinder operators obtained by van Diejen [31]:(5.18)Hr=∑J1⊂{1,…,n},|J1|=rϵi=±1,i∈J1∏i∈J1G(eϵixi)∑J2⊂J1(-1)r-|J2|U1U2∏i∈J2Txi-ϵiℏ, where r=1,…,n,(5.19)G(z)=(1-t0u0q-1z)(1+t0u0-1q-1z)(1-tnunz)(1+tnun-1z)(1-q-2z2)(1-z2),(5.20)Ub=∏i,j∈Jb\Jb+1i<jg(ϵixi+ϵjxj;t1,1)g(ϵixi+ϵjxj;q-1t12b-3,q-1)∏i∈Jb\Jb+1j∉Jbg(ϵixi+xj;t1,1)g(ϵixi-xj;t1,1), where b=1,2, J3=∅ and q=eℏ/2.
These operators commute with each other, and for r=1 we have H1=t0tn(M-e1-κt), where M-e1 is the Koornwinder operator (5.8).
Note that the operators have the form Hr=g-νrr(x)τ(-νr)+∑λ>-νrgλr(x)τ(λ), where νr=e1+⋯+er and gλr(x) are meromorphic functions such that g-νrr(x)≢0.
Hence the operators (5.18) with r=1,…,n are algebraically independent (cf.
Section 2.2).
The operators Hr are W-invariant.
Since for generic parameters the centralizer of M-e1 in the algebra of W-invariant difference operators (with suitable coefficients) coincides with the algebra R (see [22, Theorem 3.15]) we obtain Hr∈R.
Hence Hr∈R for any values of the parameters, and the restrictions of the operators Hr onto the corresponding plane D0 can be defined and they commute with each other.
Consider restriction of the operators (5.18) in the case αn∉S0.
The structure of the functions (5.20) implies that if Ub is not zero on the plane D0 then Jb have the form(5.21)Jb=Ib∪⋃ℓ=1N2{N1+kℓ-s|0≤s≤mℓb--1 or k-mℓb+≤s≤k-1},b=1,2, where I2⊂I1⊂{1,…,N1} and mℓb± are non-negative integers such that mℓ2±≤mℓ1±, mℓ1-+mℓ1+≤k and either mℓ2- or mℓ2+ vanishes for each ℓ.
Moreover, the signs ϵi are given by(5.22)ϵN1+kℓ-s={-1,if 0≤s≤mℓ1--1,+1,if k-mℓ1+≤s≤k-1.
We recall the coordinates x1,…,xN1, y1,…,yN2 defined by (4.23) on the plane D0.
Proposition 5.6
The restriction of the operator Hr takes the form(5.23)Hr¯=∑I1⊂{1,…,N1}ϵi=±1,i∈I1mℓ1±∈Z≥0,1≤ℓ≤N2|I1|+∑ℓ=1N2(mℓ1++mℓ1-)=r∏i∈I1G(eϵixi)∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2∏p=0mℓ1ϵ-1G(qt1-1-2peϵyℓ)∑I2⊂I1,mℓ2±∈Z≥0mℓ2±≤mℓ1±,mℓ2+mℓ2-=0(-1)r-|I2|-∑ℓ=1N2(mℓ2++mℓ2-)U¯1U¯2∏i∈I2Txi-ϵiℏ∏ℓ=1N2Tyℓ-(mℓ2+-mℓ2-)η1, where(5.24)U¯b=∏ℓ=1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1+mℓb+-1g(0;qt1-p-mℓ,b+1-,t1-p+mℓb+)g(0;t1-p-1-mℓb-,t1-p-1-mℓ,b+1-)∏ℓ=1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1-mℓb--1g(0;qt1-p-mℓb+,t1-p+mℓb-)∏i,j∈Ib\Ib+1i<jg(ϵixi+ϵjxj;t1,1)g(ϵixi+ϵjxj;q-1t12b-3,q-1)∏i∈Ib\Ib+1ϵ=±1j∉Ibg(ϵixi+ϵxj;t1,1)∏ℓ=1ϵ,ϵ′=±1j∉IbN2g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′xj;q12t112-mℓ,b+1ϵ,q12t112-mℓbϵ)∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1i∈Ib\Ib+1N2g(ϵixi+ϵyℓ;q12t112-mℓ,b+1ϵ,q-12t112+mℓb-ϵ)g(ϵixi+ϵyℓ;q-12t12b-32-(2-b)mℓ1ϵ,q-12t12b-32-mℓ2ϵ)∏1≤ℓ<ℓ′≤N2ϵ,ϵ′=±1∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1(g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′yℓ′;qt1-p-mℓ′,b+1ϵ′,t1-p+mℓ′b-ϵ′)g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′yℓ′;t1-p-(2-b)(1+mℓ′1ϵ′),t1-p-(2-b)-mℓ′2ϵ′))∏1≤ℓ′<ℓ≤N2ϵ,ϵ′=±1∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′yℓ′;qt1-p-mℓ′bϵ′,t1-p+mℓ′b-ϵ′)∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1g(2ϵyℓ;qt1-1-2p,t1-p+mℓb-ϵ)g(2ϵyℓ;t1-1-bp-(2-b)mℓ1ϵ,t1-2(2-b)-(3-b)p-(b-1)mℓ2ϵ), with b=1,2, I3=∅, mℓ3±=0 and q=eℏ/2, t1=eη1/2.
Note that we do not impose the condition mℓ1-+mℓ1+≤k in the sum in (5.23) since the product U¯1U¯2 vanishes if mℓ1-+mℓ1+>k, so the operators Hr¯ do not have explicit dependence on k.
Proof of Proposition 5.6
The structure of the operator (5.23) follows from the formulae (5.21), (5.22).
Let i=N1+kℓ-s∈Jℓb for some ℓ=1,…,N2, s=0,…,k-1, b=1,2.
Then the formulae (5.21), (5.22) imply that on D0 one has ϵxi=ϵyℓ+(k-12-p)η1 for some p=0,…,mℓbϵ-1 with ϵ=ϵi.
Hence the restriction of ∏i∈J1G(eϵixi) takes the form∏i∈I1G(eϵixi)∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2∏p=0mℓ1ϵ-1G(qt1-1-2peϵyℓ).
Consider the restriction of the first product in the expression (5.20) which is taken over i,j∈Jb\Jb+1.
Its part corresponding to the case i<j≤N1 is equal to∏i,j∈Ib\Ib+1i<jg(ϵixi+ϵjxj;t1,1)g(ϵixi+ϵjxj;q-1t12b-3,q-1).
For i≤N1<j we obtain(5.25)∏i∈Ib\Ib+1∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1g(ϵixi+ϵyℓ;q12t112-p,q12t1-12-p)g(ϵixi+ϵyℓ;q-12t1-12-p+2b-3,q-12t1-12-p)=∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1i∈Ib\Ib+1N2g(ϵixi+ϵyℓ;q12t112-mℓ,b+1ϵ,q12t112-mℓbϵ)g(ϵixi+ϵyℓ;q-12t12b-32-(2-b)mℓ1ϵ,q-12t12b-32-mℓ2ϵ).
Here we used the formulae∏p=mMg(z;at11-p,at1-p)=g(z;at11-m,at1-M),∏p=mMg(z;at1-1-p,at1-p)=g(z;at1-1-M,at1-m), where m,M∈Z are such that m≤M+1, a,z∈C (the second formula is used in the case b=1 only).
If N1<i<j then i=N1+kℓ-s and j=N1+kℓ′-s′, where 1≤ℓ,ℓ′≤N2, 0≤s,s′≤k-1.
If ℓ≠ℓ′ then we obtain(5.26)∏1≤ℓ<ℓ′≤N2ϵ,ϵ′=±1∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1∏p′=mℓ′,b+1ϵ′mℓ′bϵ′-1g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′yℓ;qt1-p-p′,qt1-1-p-p′)g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′yℓ;t1-1-p-p′+2b-3,t1-1-p-p′)=∏1≤ℓ<ℓ′≤N2ϵ,ϵ′=±1∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1(g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′yℓ′;qt1-p-mℓ′,b+1ϵ′,qt1-p-mℓ′bϵ′)g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′yℓ′;t1-p-(2-b)(1+mℓ′1ϵ′),t1-p-(2-b)-mℓ′2ϵ′)),while if ℓ=ℓ′ we derive the following two factors.
The factor corresponding to ϵi=-ϵj=+1 is equal to(5.27)∏ℓ=1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1+mℓb+-1∏p′=mℓ,b+1-mℓb--1g(0;qt1-p-p′,qt1-1-p-p′)g(0;t1-1-p-p′+2b-3,t1-1-p-p′)=∏ℓ=1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1+mℓb+-1g(0;qt1-p-mℓ,b+1-,qt1-p-mℓb-)g(0;t1-p-1-mℓb-,t1-p-1-mℓ,b+1-).
(In the case b=2 both sides of the equality (5.27) equal 1.) The factor corresponding to ϵi=ϵj=ϵ=±1 is equal to(5.28)∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1∏p′=p+1mℓbϵ-1g(2ϵyℓ;qt1-p-p′,qt1-1-p-p′)g(2ϵyℓ;t1-1-p-p′+2b-3,t1-1-p-p′)=∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1g(2ϵyℓ;qt1-1-2p,qt1-p-mℓbϵ)g(2ϵyℓ;t1-1-bp-(2-b)mℓ1ϵ,t1-2(2-b)-(3-b)p-(b-1)mℓ2ϵ).
Now consider the restriction of the second product in the expression (5.20) which is taken over i∈Jb\Jb+1, j∉Jb.
If 1≤i,j≤N1 we obtain∏i∈Ib\Ib+1j∉Ibg(ϵixi+xj;t1,1)g(ϵixi-xj;t1,1).
For j≤N1<i we obtain∏ℓ=1ϵ,ϵ′=±1N2∏j=1j∉IbN1g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′xj;q12t112-mℓ,b+1ϵ,q12t112-mℓbϵ).
If i≤N1<j then ϵxj=ϵyℓ+(k-12-p)η1 with p=mℓbϵ,…,k-1-mℓb-ϵ for any ϵ=±1 (it follows from j∉Jb), so we obtain(5.29)∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1i∈Ib\Ib+1N2∏p=mℓbϵk-1-mℓb-ϵg(ϵixi+ϵyℓ;q12t112-p,q12t1-12-p)=∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1i∈Ib\Ib+1N2g(ϵixi+ϵyℓ;q12t112-mℓbϵ,q-12t112+mℓb-ϵ).
If N1<i<j then i=N1+kℓ-s and j=N1+kℓ′-s′, where 1≤ℓ,ℓ′≤N2, 0≤s,s′≤k-1.
In the case ℓ≠ℓ′ we obtain(5.30)∏ℓ,ℓ′=1ℓ≠ℓ′ϵ,ϵ′=±1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1∏p′=mℓ′bϵ′k-1-mℓ′b-ϵ′g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′yℓ′;qt1-p-p′,qt1-1-p-p′)=∏ℓ,ℓ′=1ℓ≠ℓ′ϵ,ϵ′=±1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′yℓ′;qt1-p-mℓ′bϵ′,t1-p+mℓ′b-ϵ′), and for ℓ=ℓ′ we derive(5.31)∏ℓ=1ϵ,ϵ′=±1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1∏p′=mℓbϵ′k-1-mℓb-ϵ′g(ϵyℓ+ϵ′yℓ;qt1-p-p′,qt1-1-p-p′)=∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1g(0;qt1-p-mℓb-ϵ,t1-p+mℓbϵ)∏ℓ=1ϵ=±1N2∏p=mℓ,b+1ϵmℓbϵ-1g(2ϵyℓ;qt1-p-mℓbϵ,t1-p+mℓb-ϵ) (the first factor in the right-hand side corresponds to ϵ′=-ϵ and the second one corresponds to ϵ′=ϵ).
By combining the factors (5.27), (5.28) and (5.31) we obtain the beginning and ending of the formula (5.24).
Then combining (5.26) and the factors of (5.30) with ℓ<ℓ′ we obtain the corresponding factors of (5.24).
By combining (5.25) with (5.29) and taking into account all the remaining factors we obtain the formula (5.24). □
For r=1 we obtain the generalized Koornwinder operator H1¯=MN1,N2 with the parameters as in Proposition 5.4, so we get a collection of operators commuting with the operator (5.12).
Note that if ℏ=η1 the operators Hr¯ coincide with the specialization of Hr for n=N1+N2.
Thus we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 5.7
For any values of the parameters ℏ, η1, t0,tn,u0,un (u0,un≠0) the operators Hr¯ given by the formulae (5.23), (5.24), r∈Z>0, pairwise commute.
The operators Hr¯ with r=1,…,N1+N2 are algebraically independent at generic values of the parameters.
The case of DAHA of Rˆ∨ type
Let Rˆ∨={α∨|α∈Rˆ}⊂Vˆ, where R is an irreducible reduced root system in Rn⊂V≅Cn with the set of simple roots Δ={α1,…,αn}.
We have Rˆ∨≇Rˆ only for R=Bn, Cn, F4 and G2, but we will consider the general R.
Let W, Wˆ, Π, O be the same as in Section 2 and let t:Rˆ∨→C\{0} be a Wˆ-invariant function.
Put ti=tαi∨=t(αi∨) and P∨ˆ={μ=[μ(1),μ(0)]|μ(1)∈P∨,μ(0)∈ℏϵ0Z}⊂Vˆ, where ϵ0∈Z is such that (P∨,P∨)⊂ϵ0-1Z.
Then P∨ is a sublattice of P∨ˆ.
The associated DAHA is defined as follows.
Definition 6.1
(See [9,5].) Double Affine Hecke Algebra of type Rˆ∨ is the algebra tRˆ∨ generated by the elements T0,T1,…,Tn, by the set of pairwise commuting elements {Xμ}μ∈Pˆ and by the group Π={πr|r∈O} with the relations (2.4)-(2.8), (2.11) (with P∨ˆ instead of Pˆ) and(6.1)Ti-1XμTi-1=Xμ-αi∨,if (μ,αi)=1,μ∈P∨ˆ;(6.2)TiXμ=XμTi,if (μ,αi)=0,μ∈P∨ˆ; where i=0,1,…,n.
Consider the space Fˇ of functions f∈C∞(V)2πiQ holomorphic in a neighbourhood Uf of Zˇ=⋃α∈Rˆ∨{x∈V|α(x)∈2πiZ}, where C∞(V)2πiQ is the space of smooth functions f:V→C such that f(x+2πiαj)=f(x), ∀j=1,…,n.
The representation of DAHA tRˆ∨ in this space is defined by the formulae(6.3)Xμ=eμ(x),πr=πr,Ti=ti-ti-11-e-αi∨(x)+ti-1-tie-αi∨(x)1-e-αi∨(x)si, where μ∈P∨ˆ, r∈O, i=0,1,…,n, so(6.4)Tif(x)=tif(x)+(ti-1-tie-αi∨(x))g˜(x) where f∈Fˇ and g˜(x)=f(six)-f(x)1-e-αi∨(x)∈Fˇ.
Let mλ(Y) be the elements (2.22) of tRˆ∨ in the representation (6.3), where Yλ are defined by the formulae (2.12), (2.14).
Their restrictions to FˇW are difference operators Mλ=Res(mλ(Y)) spanning the commutative algebra R.
The algebra R is generated by the algebraically independent operators M-b1,…,M-bn, where bi are the fundamental coweights for R.
This is the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars system corresponding to the affine root system Rˆ∨.
In particular, it always contains the Macdonald operator(6.5)M-θ∨=∑ν∈Wθ∨(∏α∈R(α,ν)>0tα∨e(α∨,x)-tα∨-1e(α∨,x)-1)t0e(ν,x)-ℏ(θ∨,θ∨)/2-t0-1e(ν,x)-ℏ(θ∨,θ∨)/2-1(τ(ν)-1)+m-θ∨,t.
Let S0⊂Δ and let η:Rˆ∨→C be a Wˆ-invariant function (it is sufficient to define it on the subsystem R∨⊂Rˆ∨).
Define the corresponding ideal ID⊂F as follows(6.6)W+={w∈W|wS0⊂R+}⊂W,(6.7)D0=H((S0∨)′)={x∈V|(α∨,x)=ηα∨,∀α∈S0},(6.8)D=W+D0,ID={f∈F|f(x)=0,∀x∈D}.
Let R0=⨆ℓ=1mRℓ and S0=⨆ℓ=1mSℓ be the decompositions into irreducible components, where R0=〈S0〉∩R.
Let θℓ∈Rℓ be the maximal root with respect to the basis Sℓ.
Let Sℓ={αjℓ|j=1,…,kℓ}, θℓ=∑j=1kℓnjℓαjℓ and ηjℓ=η(αjℓ)∨.
Define the corresponding generalized Coxeter numbers as(6.9)hˇηℓ=(θℓ,θℓ)2ηθℓ∨+∑j=1kℓ(αjℓ,αjℓ)2njℓηjℓ.
Theorem 6.1
Suppose the subset S0⊂Δ and the invariant functions η,t satisfy hˇηℓ=ℏ for all ℓ=1,…,m and tα∨2=eηα∨ for all α∈R.
Then the ideal ID⊂Fˇ is invariant under the action of tRˆ∨.
Proof
First we define the W-invariant function η′:R→C by the formula ηα′=(α,α)2ηα∨.
Note that one can represent (6.7) as(6.10)D0=Hη′(S0)={x∈V|(α,x)=ηα′,∀α∈S0}.
By virtue of (6.10) the ideal (6.8) for the function η:R∨→C coincides with the ideal (3.12) for the function η′, moreover the conditions hˇηℓ=ℏ are equivalent to hη′ℓ=ℏ where hη′ℓ is the generalized Coxeter number for the function η′.
Hence the invariance under the action of πr follows from Proposition 3.7.
Let f∈ID and x∈wD0 for some w∈W+.
Consider first the invariance under Ti with i=1,…,n.
In the case αi∈wS0 it follows from f(x)=0 and (ti-1-tie-αi∨(x))=0.
In the case αi∉wS0 we have f(x)=f(six)=0 and the plane wD0=Hη′(wS0) does not lie in any plane H([αi∨,2πik])=H([αi,πik(αi,αi)]) due to Lemma 3.4 (see the proof of Proposition 3.5 for detail).
Consider now the invariance under T0.
If wθℓ=θ for some ℓ then α0∨(x)=ηθ∨ and t0-1-t0e-α0∨(x)=0; so that T0f(x)=0.
If wθℓ≠θ for all ℓ=1,…,m then the plane s0D0=s0Hη′(wS0) contains in D due to Lemma 3.9 and the condition hη′ℓ=ℏ.
Hence f(x)=f(s0x)=0 and T0f(x)=0 for x∈wD0 such that eα0∨(x)≠1.
Thus we are left to prove that wD0=Hη′(wS0) does not lie in the affine hyperplane H(α0∨+[0,2πik])=H(α0+[0,πik(θ,θ)]).
This is done in the same way as in the proof of Proposition 3.10. □
Let Mλ¯ be the restriction of the difference operator Mλ to the plane D0 defined as in Section 4.1.
Repeating the reasoning of Sections 4.1 and 4.2 we conclude that the operators Mλ¯ span the commutative algebra R¯ containing n¯=dimD0 algebraically independent elements.
This is the generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars system for the Rˆ∨ case.
Concluding remarks
We considered submodules in the polynomial representation of DAHA given by vanishing conditions and derived the corresponding generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators and their quantum integrals acting in the quotient module.
In some particular cases the eigenfunctions of these operators can be given by Baker-Akhiezer functions [2,3,12] but more generally the understanding of eigenfunctions is a major challenge in the area.
It follows from our construction that the restriction of a Weyl-invariant eigenfunction of the higher Macdonald operators Mλ onto the plane D0 is an eigenfunction of the corresponding operators Mλ¯.
However the question of finding the solutions is non-trivial as the specializations of the parameters so that the ideals ID are invariant are such that the Macdonald polynomials do not exist in general at these specializations.
We also note that more generally, the non-symmetric generalized eigenfunctions for the Cherednik-Dunkl operators at the special parameters are studied in [10].
Further comparison with [10] may be important for extracting the information on the eigenfunctions of the operators Mλ¯.
At generic values of the parameters for the restricted operators the eigenfunctions might have different structure and description.
Thus in type A a complete set of eigenfunctions (so-called super Macdonald polynomials) is constructed in [29] at generic η,ℏ, these polynomials are symmetric in each set of variables xi, yj and span a subspace in the space of functions of xi, yj with simple description.
It would be interesting to obtain Pieri formulae for the super Macdonald polynomials, and Theorem 4.5 might be useful.
Another important question is on the composition series of the polynomial representation.
In the case of R=AN it is given in terms of the ideals defined by vanishing ("wheel") conditions [18,11].
It would be interesting to see if the ideals ID can be used to define the composition factors in some other cases.
Further, the vanishing conditions of the submodules in the polynomial representation for the rational Cherednik algebras were helpful to establish unitarity of certain submodules [14].
It would be interesting to see if analogous approach can be applied for the case of DAHA.

Other affine root systems
The Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems and their generalized versions can be defined starting from a general affine root system.
The cases of affine root systems not considered in the main part of the paper lead to particular cases of the operators Mλ¯ from Section 5.
Nevertheless we present these cases for completeness.
Let S⊂Vˆ be an irreducible affine root system [23,25] and let W˜=W˜(S) be the group generated by {sα|α∈S} - affine Weyl group for the affine root system S. Let Δ1={a0,a1,…,an} be a basis of S and let(A.1)a¯i={ai,if 2ai∉S,2ai,if 2ai∈S,Δ2={a¯0,a¯1,…,a¯n}.
The sets S1={α∈S|α/2∉S} and S2={α∈S|2α∉S} are reduced affine root subsystems in Vˆ and Δ1 and Δ2 are bases of S1 and S2 respectively.
The group W˜ is generated by the affine simple reflections si=sai=sa¯i.
Let t:S2→C\{0} and u:S2→C\{0} be W˜-invariant functions such that uα=u(α)=1 for all α∈S1∩S2.
Let ti=ta¯i, ui=ua¯i, i=0,1,…,n.
The functions t and u are completely determined by these values and the restriction condition on u can be reformulated as ui=1 if ai=a¯i.
Consider the operators(A.2)Ti=ti+ti-1(1-tiuie-a¯i(x)/2)(1+tiui-1e-a¯i(x)/2)1-e-a¯i(x)(si-1),i=0,1,…,n.
These operators preserve the space F of smooth functions f∈C∞(V) satisfying f(x)=f(x+2πi(a¯j(1))∨) for all j=0,1,…,n and holomorphic in a neighbourhood Uf of the set ⋃α∈S{x∈V|α(x)∈2πiZ}.
Proposition A.1
The operators (A.2) satisfy the affine Hecke algebra relations (2.6) and (2.7) where mij is the order of the element sisj∈W˜.
The proposition follows from the established cases S=(Cn∨,Cn) and S=Rˆ where R is a reduced root system.
Now consider the affine root systems not covered in the previous sections.
These are S=(Bn,Bn∨), BCnˆ, (BCn,Cn) and (Cn∨,BCn).
In the above notations we have S1=Bnˆ, S2=Bnˆ∨ for S=(Bn,Bn∨), S1=S2=BCnˆ for S=BCnˆ; S1=BCnˆ, S2=Cnˆ for S=(BCn,Cn); S1=Cnˆ∨, S2=BCnˆ for S=(Cn∨,BCn).
We consider the standard realizations of these affine root systems, so in particular, S⊃Dn={±ei±ej|1≤1<j≤n}.
Define the lattice LY=Zn=PBn∨=QCn∨=PDn∨, where PBn∨, QCn∨ and PDn∨ are the coweight lattice for R=Bn, the coroot lattice for R=Cn and the coweight lattice for R=Dn respectively.
Let HSLY be the affine Hecke algebra generated by the operators Twˆ=TwˆS with wˆ∈W⋉τ(LY) defined by the formulae (2.12), (A.2).
So we consider 'extended' affine Hecke algebra for S=(Bn,Bn∨) and 'non-extended' for other cases as the group W⋉τ(LY) is the extended affine Weyl group Wˆ=Π⋉W˜(S) for S=(Bn,Bn∨) and it is the usual affine Weyl group W˜=W˜(S) for other S.
We will also consider the 'non-extended' affine Hecke algebras HSLY for S=Cnˆ and Cnˆ∨, where LY is as above.
The Cherednik-Dunkl operators Yλ=YSλ, λ∈LY, are defined by the formula Yμ-ν=Tτ(μ)Tτ(ν)-1, where μ,ν∈P+∨∩LY.
These operators form the commutative subalgebra C[YSLY]⊂HSLY.
The elements mλ(Y)=∑ν∈WλYν preserve the space of invariants FW, their restrictions Mλ=mλ|FW form commutative algebra RLY of difference operators.
The simplest operators in this algebra has the form(A.3)M-ν=1|W-ν|∑w∈Wg-ν(w-1x)(τ(-wν)-1)+const, where ν is a minuscule coweight br or ν=θ∨, and(A.4)g-ν(x)=∏α∈S2(-ν)(1-tαuαeα(x)/2)(1+tαuα-1eα(x)/2)tα(1-eα(x)), where S2(-ν)=S2-∩(τ(-ν)S2+), S2+=-S2-={α∈S2|α(x)>0 whenever a¯i(x)>0,∀i=0,1,…,n}.
The following diagram explains how one gets the subalgebras C[YSLY]⊂HSLY by specializing the parameters starting from the subalgebra generated by the Cherednik-Dunkl operators in the (Cn∨,Cn) DAHA.
We also include in the diagram the affine Hecke algebras parts of DAHA of Rˆ and Rˆ∨ type where R=Bn,Dn.
The double arrows in the diagram mean the isomorphism of the corresponding Cherednik-Dunkl subalgebras under the specialization and the single arrows mean the embedding of these subalgebras.
The parameters t0,tn,u0,un are the parameters of the operators (A.2) for S=(Cn∨,Cn).
The validity of these isomorphisms essentially follows from the following two lemmas.
Lemma A.2
If t0=u0=1 then the affine Hecke algebra H(Cn∨,Cn)Q∨ coincides with the affine Hecke algebra H(Bn,Bn∨)P∨.
More exactly, under the specialization the generators correspond as(A.5)Ti(Cn∨,Cn)=Ti(Bn,Bn∨),T0(Cn∨,Cn)=π1(Bn,Bn∨), where i=1,…,n, and the Cherednik-Dunkl operators correspond as Y(Cn∨,Cn)λ=Y(Bn,Bn∨)λ, ∀λ∈LY.
Proof
The affine Hecke algebra H(Cn∨,Cn)Q∨ is generated by T0(Cn∨,Cn),T1(Cn∨,Cn),…,Tn(Cn∨,Cn) while the algebra H(Bn,Bn∨)P∨ is generated by π1(Bn,Bn∨),T1(Bn,Bn∨),…,Tn(Bn,Bn∨).
The operators Ti(Cn∨,Cn) and Ti(Bn,Bn∨) coincide for each i=1,…,n (at any parameters) so denote them by Ti.
The operator T0(Cn∨,Cn) at the specialization of parameters becomes s0(Cn∨,Cn)=τ(e1)se1=π1(Bn,Bn∨).
Thus we are left to prove the formula Y(Cn∨,Cn)λ=Y(Bn,Bn∨)λ at this specialization.
It is enough to check this formula for λ=ei, i=1,…,n.
From the definition one yields Y(Cn∨,Cn)e1=T0(Cn∨,Cn)Tse1(Cn∨,Cn) and Y(Bn,Bn∨)e1=π1(Bn,Bn∨)Tse1(Bn,Bn∨).
Then for i=2,…,n the equality Y(Cn∨,Cn)ei=Y(Bn,Bn∨)ei follows by induction from the formula YSei=Ti-1-1YSei-1Ti-1-1 valid for both S=(Cn∨,Cn) and S=(Bn,Bn∨). □
Consider now S=Dnˆ, n≥2.
The simple roots of Dn are αi=ei-ei+1 for i=1,…,n-1 and αn=en-1+en.
Denote by πrDn, TiDn the corresponding elements of the algebra HDnˆP∨ where r∈O={0,1,n-1,n}, i=0,1,…,n.
Note that if tn=1 then the affine Hecke algebra HBnˆP∨ in the representation (2.19) coincides with the affine Hecke algebra HBnˆ∨P∨ in the representation (6.3).
Indeed, the algebras HBnˆP∨, HBnˆ∨P∨ have the only different generator Tn which becomes Tn=sen at tn=1.
Since the corresponding operators π1,Ti of the algebras HBnˆP∨ and HBnˆ∨P∨ coincide at this specialization we denote them by π1Bn, TiBn where i=0,…,n.
Lemma A.3
At the specialization tn=1 one has(A.6)YBnˆλ=YBnˆ∨λ=YDnˆλ for all λ∈LY.
That is the corresponding algebras are embedded at this specialization: C[YBnˆP∨]=C[YBnˆ∨P∨]⊂C[YDnˆP∨].
Proof
Note first that the operators TiBn and TiDn coincide for i=1,…,n-1 (at any parameters) and we denote them by Ti.
Since TnBn=sen (at the specialization tn=1) we obtain(A.7)π1Dn=τ(e1)se1sen=π1BnTnBn,TnDn=snTn-1sn=(TnBn)-1Tn-1TnBn.
Comparing the expressions(A.8)YBne1=π1BnT1…Tn-2Tn-1TnBnTn-1…T1,(A.9)YDne1=π1DnT1…Tn-2TnDnTn-1…T1 we derive YBne1=YDne1.
Due to the formula YRei=Ti-1-1YRei-1Ti-1-1 valid for both R=Bn and R=Dn we establish the equality (A.6) for all λ=ei, where i=1,…,n, and, hence, for all λ∈LY. □
It follows that the operators Mλ for the affine root system S coincide with the operators Mλ from Section 5 at the corresponding specialization.
In particular the specializations of the Koornwinder operator (5.8) give the operators M-e1 determined by (A.3).
The specializations of the generalized Koornwinder operator (5.12) give the generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators M-e1¯ for the affine root system S. Each specialization of the operators Mλ¯ from Section 5 gives commutative algebra containing the operator M-e1¯.
These algebras were constructed in Sections 4, 6 for S=Bnˆ,Dnˆ,Bnˆ∨.
For other cases the invariant ideals and these operators can also be defined using the specialization of the invariant ideals for S=(Cn∨,Cn).
For example consider the case S=(Bn,Bn∨), so S2=Bnˆ∨.
Let η:Bn∨→C be a W-invariant function and let S0 be a subset of the set of simple roots of Bn.
Define the ideal ID by the formulae (6.7) and (6.8).
Let S0=⨆ℓ=1mSℓ be the decomposition to the irreducible components S1,…,Sm⊂S0.
Let hˇηℓ be the corresponding generalized Coxeter number defined by (6.9).
Let Fˇ be the space defined in Section 6 for R=Bn.
Then the following statement takes place.
Theorem A.4
Suppose that t12=eη1 if n>1, ϵntnunϵn=eηn/2 for some ϵn=±1 and hˇηℓ=ℏ for all ℓ=1,…,m.
Then the ideal ID⊂Fˇ is invariant under the actions of the operators (A.2) and π1.
The corresponding generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operator M¯-e1 can be obtained by the specialization of the parameters in the generalized Koornwinder operator (5.12).
